#+title: my 2017 Dell Inspiron
* My machine is
  a Dell Inspiron, 15".
  It has SKU number 0767. I haven't found a map from that to an actual model.
  Amazon says my machine is a "i5-7200U" but I think that's the chip.
* BIOS setup, how to access
  Press F2 while booting, when the Dell logo appears.
