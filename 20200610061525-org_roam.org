* PITFALL: move org-roam files [[id:b21e2b07-d97f-4135-ae22-8b8737075ce8][using dired]]
  This causes updates to the org-roam db.
  Maybe other Emacs file-moving facilities (e.g. neotree)
  would do the same.
  moving them from a shell certainly doesn't.
* PITFALL: What to do if [[id:342a603e-98e2-4f54-a53b-5eb2ec830948][org-roam can't follow a link]].

   C-TAB
   That's a standard magit-section command. The org-roam (backlink) buffer relies on magit-section.
   I don't know why there are a few lines of whitespace under each backlink, but this makes them go away.
** to rebuild the cache
   M-x -db-s
** link descriptions are automatically refactored
*** maybe only in a newer version than the one I use?
*** this can be disabled:

** DONE (learned) linking to headers
*** only available in version 1.2
*** create header, then run `org-roam-store-link` (C-c L)
*** insert it with org-insert-link                (C-c C-l)
 This is part of org-mode, not org-roam.
*** this has no link
** a backlink is not visible until saved
that is, by saving the file that contains the backlink,
after creating the backlink
** To use a weird symbol (e.g. '\' or ',') in an alias
   Enclose the whole tag in parens.
   Write '\' as \\.
* TODO tweak
** TODO [[id:0663ea6c-5764-408c-a627-899d5e3108df][use Nix to install org-roam]]
** TODO update Docker image for org-roam v. 1.2
** TODO can I make more TODO-like tags for org-mode?
** TODO how to tab-complete from the middle?
** TODO how to rename a file?
   particularly if I can't
   tab-complete from the middle
