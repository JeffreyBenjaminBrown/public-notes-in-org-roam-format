#+title: Bosanquet mapping for equal temperaments
* definiing it
** it's regular
** on a hex grid with six directions, up, down, up-right, down-right, etc.
** perfect fourth = 2 up-right, 1 down-right
** perfect fifth = 3 up-right, 1 down-right
* implies 9/8 is an adjacent step
* supposedly makes big EDOs playable
* downside: the smallest intervals in pitch are not smallest on the keyboard
