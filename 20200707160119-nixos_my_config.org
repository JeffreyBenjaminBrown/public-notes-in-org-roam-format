#+title: NixOS, my config
* TODO [[id:80c451e8-da34-4d5f-8483-f3e3b56ff16b][do I want org-roam to work with company? helm? both?]]
* TODO ? m31 will not connect
  I tried adding "samsung-unified-linux-driver" to packages.nix; it would not build. Also it might not be relevant; the description says it's for printers, and does not mention phones.
  This page
    https://forum.kde.org/viewtopic.php?f=224&t=143115
  suggests modifying the "69-libmtp.rules" file. I have five such files. The first I checked already had the change the page describes.
* TODO ? I lost my .stack/config.yaml file
  I had configured it for something ... maybe this, which also appears in my local stack.yaml files?
```
nix:
  enable: true
```
* TODO ? unfinished from 20.09 installation
** transfer from from the old (20.03) configuration.nix
  boot.extraModulePackages = [
      config.boot.kernelPackages.exfat-nofuse ];
  system.autoUpgrade.enable = true;
** ? transfer from the auto-generated configuration.nix file
currently saved at
  jbb-config/install-20.09/by-nixos-generate-config/configuration.nix
I'm not sure I want any of that stuff; I don't know what most of it is.
* PITFALL : switchingo to unstable killed my system
I had to reinstall the OS before I could nixos-rebuild again.
Although I eventually found I could install new stuff with `nix-env -i`.

* PITFALL: to record video with camera and mic
I use a separate NixOS config,
which uses PulseAudio to feed the mic into [[id:0224f2ae-1ce8-4019-8ebf-240379a10fad][cheese]]
* PITFALL: my config outside of .nix files
