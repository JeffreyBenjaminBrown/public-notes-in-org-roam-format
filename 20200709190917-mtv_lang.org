* TODO top priorities
** TODO easy-ish
*** Synth param homogenization: off? on? both?
    Better words: "start" and "stop".
      Where "stop" means "begin the stop sequence".
    "off" in Zot is used to trigger the terminating envelope.
    "on" in the others is, I think, just a multiplier, just like "amp".
    But "on" could also be used to trigger a starting envelope.
    Difficult: Dispatch has the functions to insert "on" defined in Museq.Mk.
** TODO hard
*** TODO pitch smarts
**** Distinguish (by, say, gravity): root, chord, scale.
**** Inversions?
**** Voice coordination.
     Order the voices; corrections are applied as needed in order starting from the last voice.
***** "Among these 3 voices, at least 2 should play from the chord."
***** "Any time voices start at the same time ..."
      alternatives
****** Find the next start time and stagger them across the intervening time, per this unit-time rhythm.
****** Pitch one of them up, quiet it, and delay its onset a little.
*** TODO rhythm smarts
**** ? global grid, beat weight map
**** transform rhythm
***** why it's hard
****** globalism
       It's a global property of the start times -- they can't be individually modified, but rather must be modified in a manner aware of neighboring notes.
****** quantisation
       One can't stretch start times arbitrarily and expect it to sound good. They need to be stretched in a grid-aware way.
***** apply rhtyhm from one sequence to another
      esp. if the rhythm is shorter.
**** ordinal ops
***** = manipulate sequences by order disregarding timing
     (ordinal but not cardinal).
***** describe ordinal subsets of sequences:
****** slices
****** modular arithmetic expressions (e.g. "everything 2 or 3 mod 4")
***** swap two ordinal subsets of a museq
      They need to not overlap.
*** TODO Need data. Try making sequences.
    I won't know which of these problems matters, or which matters more,
    until I've frustrated over sequences for a while.
*** TODO Trace dispatchLoop and friends.
    Because I don't really know what's happening.
*** background states for voices
**** motivation: can't adjust a parameter that's not in a Museq
**** motivation: restore a Zot to reasonable parameter values
***** Idea: a map from voices to all params that have been modified in it.
***** Idea: a way to change the synth without using a Museq.
*** events longer than the host Museq's sup0 make no sense
**** Events correspond to named monophonic voices,
     so an event from this cycle cannot audibly overlap with itself from the next cycle.
**** can concatenation (append & cat) screw with event durations?
***** problem statement
      Consider a Museq `m` with dur=sup=1 and a single event,
      which starts at 0 and ends on 2.
      That event is supposed to have duration 2.
      If you concatenate another Museq `n` to the end of that one,
      will the event in `m` now have duration 2 + (duration of `n`)?
***** exploratory code
      p1 = mm 1 $ pre3 "a" [ (0, 1.5, m1 "freq" 300),
                             (0.5, 1, m1 "on" 0 ) ]
      p2 = mm 1 $ pre3 "b" [ (0, 1.5, m1 "freq" 350) ]
      p3 = mm 2 $ pre3 "c" [ (0, 1, m1 "freq" 450),
                             (1, 2, m1 "on" 0) ]
     
      chAll $ mfl [
	("1", nVap $ insertOns $ cat [p1, p2] ),
	("2", nVap $ insertOns p3) ]
*** Are the ends of events meaningful?
    For instance, in Dispatch.Dispatch.dispatchLoop,
    they appear not to be used:
	evs0 :: [(Time, Action)]
          = concatMap f $ M.elems mqs' where
          f :: Museq String Action
            -> [(Time, Action)] -- start times and actions
          f m = map (\ev -> ((ev^.evStart), (ev^.evData))) evs
            where evs = arc time0 tempoPeriod startRender
			(startRender + frameDuration) m
*** schedule a replaceAll
    for, say, the next cycle equal to 0 modulo 16
**** TODO better: schedule for after when `seq` evaluates the `Museq` completely
*** delete duplicate drums
    That is, if two instances of the same sample are scheduled simultaneously, delete one of them. (Or maybe do something else -- maybe de-pitch one of them slightly? But playing the sample twice as loud is jarring.)
*** amplitude group for all drums, all pitched tracks
*** speed

* TODO BUG: initial splash
** too many events sound simultaneously when it first starts
* TODO misc
** gui
*** motivation: can't understand why it souonds like it does
*** motivation: can't adjust individual notes
** laziness
Because evaluating a whole sequence before playing any of it can cause a huge dealy.
*** ugly compromise: keep both instructions and maybe the data
The data would still be evaluated in its entirely rather than as needed.
But once it is evaluated, it is kept.
** use defaults in, e.g., amp :: (Float -> Float) -> Museq -> Museq
   This might be stale.
   Certainly "amp" and "ampTo", which it refers to, are no longer defined.
*** the idea
   Currently there are both "amp" and "ampTo";
   one takes a function, the other a value.
   I could stick to the one that takes a function,
   if it assumed the default value when that value is not present.

*** idea: add Maybe to Note, and banish bare Msg values in a Museq
    Stop using the Museq ScParams type.
    Instead use Museq Note',
    where Note' is like Note but the synthdef is wrapped in a Maybe.

** TODO is the sccheduling a frame too conservative?
   In Dispatch.replaceAll, there's this:
       when = nextPhase0 time0 frameDuration now + frameDuration
         -- `when` = the end of the first not-yet-rendered frame.
         -- TODO (speed) ? Is this conservative? Do I not need to

   Theere's a similar addition of a `frameDuration` in `chTempoPeriod`.
** TODO Can it be lazy?
** TODO could it be smarter about `ScAction` size? Does it matter?
*** why I think it's curretly wasteful
    See, e.g., this type signature:
    boopMsg :: Msg -> [Msg' BoopParams]
*** the idea, verbose form
    (see dispatchConsumeScAction_Send and freinds)
    The ScAction type can carry a lot of different parameter instructions, but currently I only send singletons. Does that matter, or is the cost of sending a different ScAction for each parameter negligible?
    Do the Museq-creating helper functions bundle simultaneous parameters into the same ScAction?

** timeForBoth_toFinish v. timeForBoth_toAppearToFinish
*** the tradeoff
**** timeForBoth_toFinish is "safer"
stack used to be written in terms of timeForBoth_toAppearToFinish,
but that led to this bug

> c2 = dur .~ 2 $ mmh 1 $ pre2 "" $ [ (0, "a") ]
> c2
Museq {_dur = 2 % 1, _sup = 1 % 1, _vec = [Event {_evLabel = "", _evArc = (0 % 1,1 % 1), _evData = "a"}]}
> stack c2 c2
Museq {_dur = 2 % 1, _sup = 1 % 1, _vec = []}
**** timeForBoth_toAppearToFinish can be more efficient
In the case of stack, if the time to repeat is less than the time to play through,
the result of stacking two things can be a lot smaller if they are not looped all the way through.
*** solutions
**** it's not really that timeForBoth_toFinish is "safer"
 I'm sure there's a good way to do it -- just, like, check that it won't fuck up.
**** another, also best-of-both-worlds, solution
 Use timeToFinish,
 but then rewrite the result more concisely if possible.
*** might be a problem with merge

*** why
 The "_ in <pattern name> at <time>"
 relationship is polymorphic in its first member.

 My two options are to split it into multiple rels
 ("param _ in _ at _", "scale _ in _ at _", etc.)
 or to reify the elements of Dispatch into a single type.

 The first is nicer to code,
 but it means duplicating lots of functions,
 which sucks for the user who has to remember them.
** extend graph language

 functions

** play song from UI
*** modify Hode to let using code add to the UI
** how to cut through the boilerplate in Vivid.Hode?
 HExpr helped, but there ought to be a way to build all those functions from a single HExprF.
