#+title: "Base Caller" Software
It "calls bases", like an umpire calls strikes, etc.
* confidence varies
If the split is close to fifty-fifty, it will not be confident.
* logarithmic "base quality"
(Base quality = Q) = 10 * log_10 (p = Pr(incorrect))

This way, Q = 10 <=> 1 in 10 chance of wrong.
          Q = 100 <=> 1 in 100 chance of wrong.
          etc.
