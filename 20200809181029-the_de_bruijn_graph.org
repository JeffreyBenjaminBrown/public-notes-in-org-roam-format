#+title: The De Bruijn Graph (bioinformatics)
"Bruijn" rhyms with "coin".
* It's a multigraph,
i.e. one where multiple edges can start and end in the same place.
* It's an Eulerian graph
meaning it can be walked.
* the algorithm
** Suppose you've read every kmer from the text.
** Divide each kmer into two (k-1)mers
** Each (k-1)mer becomes a node in the graph.
** Add an edge connecting the first (k-1)mer to the second in each kmer.
** walk the graph.
If there's only one walk, that's the answer.
If there's more than one, it's one of them.
* It does not overcollapse repeats.
unlike SES solutions.
* PITFALL: It depends strongly on an unrealistic assumption
that we get exactly one kmer starting at every position in T.
We can always build the De Bruijn graph, but in practice
it will never be Eulerian.
