* TODO ? find all 8-string-ish thanos tunings for an edo
  (That is, strings 0 through 7.)

  Let s' = edo / 7 -- s' as in close to the spacing
  Let s = a few integers on either side of s'.
  Let o' = (s * 7). -- o' as in close to the octave
  Compute m = edo - o'.
  If m and s are relatively prime,
    show at the thanos tuning for edo, modulus = m, spacing = s.
* TODO collect intervals automatically
* TODO search over all moduli
up to, say, 16
* TODO filter by max-12-edo distance
** TODO make including the octave optional for computing maximum stretch.
 For instance, 22\84 mod 5 works astoundingly well if one ignores that.
* TODO filter by fret size
* TODO filter by MSE of the EDO
