#+title: Django Database
* models are classes *and* databases
Every "model" (e.g. Choice and Question in the polls/ example) is
  as a class in Python
  *and* as a table in the database.
* a field's arguments depend on the subtype of Field chosen
Some Field classes have required arguments.
Each Field can be given an optional human-readable name as its first arg.
* ForeignKey associates items in one model with another
e.g. this code
  class Choice(models.Model):
      question = models.ForeignKey( Question,
                                    on_delete = models.CASCADE)
      ...
says each Choice is associated with some Question.
