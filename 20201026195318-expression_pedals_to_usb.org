#+title: Expression Pedals to USB
* Haskell for midi
** Alsa or JACK is probably the better ways to go
*** how to get them
I already have them, at ~/tempd
They're all in Darcs but also downloadable from Hackage.
*** how to learn them
**** they both come with examples
PITFALL: That's not evident from Hackage.
**** Both might be better learned from their C implementations
I tried looking through their Hackage docs and was quite confused.
This might be the foundational C implementation for ALSA:

** Haskell's portMIDI looks simple to use but with a bad IO paradigm
* "MIDI Expression Quattro": $125, converts 4 pedals to MIDI
including 14-bit (4096 values) resolution pitchbend.

* 1/4" TRS output expression pedals are cheap

* How would TRS to USB work?
