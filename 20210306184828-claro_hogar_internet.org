* paying Claro
** the website

** TODO is the "Cuenta o Ref. de Pago" always this?
   60155948
** PITFALL: The service can hang
   If I click Boton Bancolombia, it will wait for a not-forthcoming response from Bancolombia, and meanwhile won't let me attempt any other payment method. I'll have to wait for it to timeout.
** PITFALL: Never click Boton Bancolombia
* TODO canceling claro for 402 Urapanes
** DONE
   I'm 99% sure I did this -- someone came and picked it up --
   and 95% sure they then called me to ask if it had happened,
   and I said yes. That may have been January, or before.
   It's March 6 2021 today.
