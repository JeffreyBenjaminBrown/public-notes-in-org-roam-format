* PIFALL: might need (require '<package name>) when first installinga
  Evaluating that may have allowed me to get some packages working that otherwise weren't. But later I was able to run them without having that expression in my .emacs file.
* TODO ask about | look for
** next/previous non-whitespace
** something to show brackets, parens, etc. in another color?
** I would like the highlight to remain after changing the indentation of a lot of adjacent bullets, so that I can do it again.
* TODO read through these package lists
** resume reading package list (searching "tree") at Kill Ring (section)
** resume reading awesome-emacs at section Project Management
   https://github.com/emacs-tw/awesome-emacs
* packages of interest
** important (and maybe easy)
*** docker
*** evil-mode
*** wgrep - Writable grep/ack/ag/pt buffer and apply the changes to files.
*** grip-mode - Instant Github-flavored Markdown/Org preview using Grip
*** ace-link
*** back-button
    "Visual navigation through mark rings in Emacs"
    Through global and (buffer-)local mark rings.
    Leaves visible marks at each spot.
*** cruz - "a collection of ridiculously useful Emacs [functions]"
*** git-timemachine: step through old versions of a file
*** multi-term - Multiple terminals, and more useable.
    In particular, will kill a process when you exit the terminal.
*** Project management : whole section of awesome-emacs
*** git-link - get the GitHub/Bitbucket/GitLab/... URL for a buffer location
*** markdown-toc
** easy
*** helm-file-preview
*** helm-taskswitch
*** helm-org
*** Keys Cheat Sheet: a whole section of awesome-emacs
*** google-translate
*** expand-region
*** artist-mode
    draw boxes etc. with mouse, keyboard
*** diff-hl - Highlights uncommitted changes.
*** SyMon - tiny graphical system monitor
*** org-download: Drag and drop images to Emacs org-mode
*** twittering-mode
*** key-quiz - test your Emacs knowledge
*** bm - visual bookmarks
    Unlike the mark ring, the user chooses where the bookmarks are,
    can delete them when needed, etc.
*** move-text - move current line or region up or down.
*** pdf-view-restore - remember your place
    addition to PDF Tools. saves the current position in a PDF to resume reading at that place even after the buffer has been closed.
** maybe neither
*** helm-ext
    Seems cool.
*** pdf-tools
    read, search, follow links, edit annotations, kill text (!), jump to LaTeX source, adjust colors for lighting
*** multifiles - View and edit parts of multiple files in one buffer.
*** lentic - Create views of the same content in two Emacs buffers.
*** org-web: edit org files on mobile, synced to GDrive or Dropbox
*** imenu-anywhere : imenu over all buffers, using helm
*** ialign: interactive regexes, like align-columns but stronger
*** org-noter: annotate PDF, EPUB, Microsoft Office, DVI, PS, and OpenDocument
    Annotations are in a separate file.
*** Mail, IRC, Chat, RSS : whole sections of awesome-emacs
*** theme-magic - Apply your Emacs theme to the rest of Linux.
*** HaRe - Haskell refactoring
*** visual-regexp
*** ov - change text appearance (temporarily, I think)
* DONE ? gave up on
** were of interest but look complex
*** icicles -- cycle buffers with arrows and tab completion
    but not part of Melpa
*** treefactor
*** treemacs (like neotree)
** couldn't get working
*** highlight-escape-sequences
    Installed from MELPA; seemed to do nothing.
    Maybe I need to customize it
      /(e.g. maybe `M-x customize-group hes-mode`).
    Apparently also available from GNU itself (per package-list-packages) but I don't know how to use such packages in my emacs.nix file.
* DONE ? I probably prefer something else
** [[id:424cea04-5013-4547-8e24-65522ab90c56][vertigo]]
** helm-swoop
   Split-pane text search.
   Turns out I don't look at the pane of search results.
*** emacs code I was using for it
    ;; helm-swoop: two-panel string matching
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-j s") 'helm-swoop)
** avy : nah, I prefer simple C-s and C-r
*** code I was using for it
;; avy : jump around
(global-set-key (kbd "C-;") 'avy-goto-char-2)
* remember, is great (and installed)
** (smart-)hungry-delete
   Delete lots of whitespace.
** restart-emacs
** imenu : provides a menu of spots in a document to jump to
** undo-tree
   undo-tree-visualize			-- first enable undo-tree-mode
   undo-tree-diff			-- or 'd' from in it
   undo-tree-visualizer-timestamps	-- or 't' from in it
** [[id:e217215b-88ef-4a18-a96b-1b17272fe86b][ace-window (Emacs package)]]
** block-nav
   If I decide I don't like that, try emacs-spatial-navigate:
   https://gitlab.com/ideasman42/emacs-spatial-navigate
** iflipb: change buffers fast
** goto-last-change
** [[id:ad6bd612-dd7b-4185-bd04-e2aade240c4c][ctrlf]] : text search
** restart-emacs
** DONE internalized
*** mwim
*** rainbow-delimiters
    Installed via Melpa\Nix.
    The only thing it defined is rainbow-delimiters-mode -- it didn't define rainbow-delimiters-faces or
*** linum-relative (elpa)
*** [[id:390f0d15-8ad0-407e-961f-035ee4816498][multiple cursors (Emacs package)]]
* remember, commands
** M-m: first non-whitespace char in line
** C-c C-(f/b): org next/previous same level
** Up, down and search work in the minibuffer after M-x.
