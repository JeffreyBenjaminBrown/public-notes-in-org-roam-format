* PIFALL: might need (require '<package name>) when first installinga
  Evaluating that may have allowed me to get some packages working that otherwise weren't. But later I was able to run them without having that expression in my .emacs file.
* TODO ask about | look for
** next/previous non-whitespace
** something to show brackets, parens, etc. in another color?
** I would like the highlight to remain after changing the indentation of a lot of adjacent bullets, so that I can do it again.

** `C-x space` is a better way to delineate rectangles.
