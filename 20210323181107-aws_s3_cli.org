= The Command Line Interface for AWS S3
* setup the AWS CLI
** there's also the (slower) web UI
   Individual files can be uploaded and downloaded (by mouse)
   to S3 from aws.amazon.com
** create a user with IAM
*** find IAM on aws.amazon.com
*** find Users in the left scrollbar
*** click Add User
    choose "Programmatic Access"
    (the other choice requires typing a password each time)
*** when confronted with policies, choose an existing one
    Administrative Access = total access.
** install, configure the AWS CLI
 at shell: "aws configure"
 use the key fields from file downloaded from IAM
 default region = us-east-1
 default output format = json
