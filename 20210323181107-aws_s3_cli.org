#+title: AWS S3 CLI
= The Command Line Interface for AWS S3
* setup the AWS CLI
** there's also the (slower) web UI
   Individual files can be uploaded and downloaded (by mouse)
   to S3 from aws.amazon.com
** create a user with IAM
*** find IAM on aws.amazon.com
*** find Users in the left scrollbar
*** click Add User
    choose "Programmatic Access"
    (the other choice requires typing a password each time)
*** when confronted with policies, choose an existing one
    Administrative Access = total access.
** install, configure the AWS CLI
   at shell: "aws configure"
   use the key fields from file downloaded from IAM
   default region = us-east-1
   default output format = json
