#+title: AWS, frequently used commands
* TODO for speed, use the AWS EC2 CLI
* some variables I'll need
** username depends on the AMI used
   Amazon Linux => my name is "ec2-user"
   Ubuntu => my name is "ubuntu"
* the commands
** define my AWS-related shell variables

*** example
    JBB_AWS_HOST=35.175.120.10
    JBB_AWS_USER=ubuntu
      (or ec2-user, if using Amazon Linux)
    JBB_AWS_PEM=~/super/secret/path.pem
    ssh -i $JBB_AWS_PEM $JBB_AWS_USER@$JBB_AWS_HOST
** visit a file over ssh from native Emacs
   C-x C-f (the usual "open file" shortcut)
   /ssh:$JBB_AWS_USER@$JBB_AWS_HOST:/home/$JBB_AWS_USER/tax.co.web/commands.sh
*** PITFALL: required: edit .ssh/config
    Should say something like this (left-justified):
    Host 18.231.152.118
         User $JBB_AWS_USER
         IdentityFile /home/jeff/code/aws/secret/JBB_AWS_PEM
** add space to a volume
*** first get the space from Amazon
    https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/requesting-ebs-volume-modifications.html
**** stop the instance
**** in the EC2 concsole, select Volumes
     The EC2 console is a menu up from my usual view of Instances.
**** from Actions choose Modify Volume
*** then "extend the filesystem" to use it
    https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/recognize-expanded-volume-linux.html
**** PITFALL: The `growpart` command
     takes the path of the root volume, not the partition.
     To grow a specific partition to fill the root volume,
     indicate the partition number.

     For instance, if lsblk reveals the following:

         [ec2-user@ip-172-31-79-192 ~]$ lsblk
         NAME          MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
         nvme0n1       259:0    0  45G  0 disk
         ├─nvme0n1p1   259:1    0  45G  0 part /
         └─nvme0n1p128 259:2    0   1M  0 part

     then the proper command is

         sudo growpart /dev/nvme0n1 1
**** the commands I used
     These depend on the names I found using `df -hT` and `lsblk`.
***** worked for me on Ubuntu
      sudo growpart /dev/xvda 1
	# grow partition 1 of xvda
      sudo xfs_growfs -d /
	# grow the / folder, because that's where xvda is mounted to
***** worked for me one Amazon Linux
      sudo growpart /dev/nvme0n1 1
      sudo xfs_growfs -d /
** restart a stopped instance
*** in the EC2 console
    reboot. wait a bit.
    start. might have to try a few times, or maybe the browser needs a refresh.
    note the new IPv4 address.
*** change the IPv4 address in Route53
    Choose "Edit record", then see the sidebar.
*** update the IPv4 address in my .ssh/config
*** via ssh
**** restart dockerd
     sudo dockerd &
** ssh (secure shell)
   ssh  -i  <keyfile>  $JBB_AWS_USER@$JBB_AWS_HOST
*** lately
    ssh -i $JBB_AWS_PEM $JBB_AWS_USER@$JBB_AWS_HOST
** scp (secure copy)
*** pull
    scp -i <keyfile> user@host:/remote-path /local/path
*** push
    scp -i <keyfile> /local/path user@host:/remote-path
*** lately
