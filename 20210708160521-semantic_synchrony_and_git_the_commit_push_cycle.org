#+title: Semantic Synchrony and Git: the commit-push cycle
* PITFALL: DON'T PULL until committing.
* Write to VCS.
  C-c  C-w  c
* Run "lost-nodes.sh"
  cd /home/jeff/Encfs/kb-no-encfs/vcs
  bash ~/smsn+/git-smsn/lost-nodes.sh
* Use magit to commit
  after loading each of these files, run magit
** ~/Encfs/kb-no-encfs/vcs/public/001IGm9ypXayWoiA.smsn
** ~/Encfs/kb-no-encfs/vcs/universal/ZC9qvo57MpCv7Si2.smsn
** ~/Encfs/kb-no-encfs/vcs/personal/HSn5Vb7ERrybcWZU.smsn
** ~/Encfs/kb-no-encfs/vcs/private/5BsOZge3XkSvLNsL.smsn
** ~/Encfs/kb-no-encfs/vcs/observatorio/VFkwsk7AQFUAwRMN.smsn
* *Then* delete things.
  Do this in a second commit so that in the first commit,
  if anything was deleted that shouldn't have been,
  it will be obvious, not camouflaged by these deletes.
** the recipe
   cd /home/jeff/Encfs/kb-no-encfs/vcs
   grep "^@title \[delete" -r . > to-delete.txt
   Then look at each line of that file from within SmSn.
* pull, then push
* stop SmSn
* delete the old repo
* restart SmSn
* read from VCS
  C-c  C-r  c
