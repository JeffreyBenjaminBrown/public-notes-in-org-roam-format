#+title: Semantic Synchrony and Git: the commit-push cycle
* PITFALL: DON'T PULL until committing.
* Write to VCS.
  C-c  C-w  c
* Run "lost-nodes.sh"
  cd /home/jeff/Encfs/kb-no-encfs/vcs
  bash ~/smsn+/git-smsn/lost-nodes.sh
* Use magit to commit
** Don't delete yet.
** After loading each of these files, run magit
*** ~/Encfs/kb-no-encfs/vcs/public/001IGm9ypXayWoiA.smsn
*** ~/Encfs/kb-no-encfs/vcs/universal/ZC9qvo57MpCv7Si2.smsn
*** ~/Encfs/kb-no-encfs/vcs/personal/HSn5Vb7ERrybcWZU.smsn
*** ~/Encfs/kb-no-encfs/vcs/private/5BsOZge3XkSvLNsL.smsn
*** ~/Encfs/kb-no-encfs/vcs/observatorio/VFkwsk7AQFUAwRMN.smsn
* *Then* delete things.
** why this is a separate step
   Do this in a second commit so that in the first commit,
   if anything was deleted that shouldn't have been,
   it will be obvious, not camouflaged by these deletes.
** the recipe
*** Examine things marked for deletion.
    cd /home/jeff/Encfs/kb-no-encfs/vcs
    grep "^@title \[delete" -r . > to-delete.txt
    Then look at each line of that file from within SmSn.
*** Edit anything that should not be deleted.
    Take "to delete" away from its title.
*** Run `git rm <file>` for every file to be deleted.
*** Commit.
* pull, then push
* stop SmSn
* delete the old neo4j/ folder
* restart SmSn
* read from VCS
