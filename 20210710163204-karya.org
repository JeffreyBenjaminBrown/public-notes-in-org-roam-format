#+title: Karya (music software)
* what Karya is
** Music scoring/generation suite, written in Haskell
** Does clever caching to avoid re-rendering.
   Audio snippets are cached ala Nix.
   GUI images are cached more simply.
** Kinds of IO
*** Uses Faust
    which is faster and less friendly than SuperCollider.
*** Uses FLTK for GUI
    which is 90s old school.
*** Can output to a DAW (I think), or at least to a VST host.
** Heroic
   180K LOC, 15 year history, only 1 developer.
* nix concerns
 `systemctl cat jackd` once running jack.
 Find out where qjackctl gets jack from.
* ? osc, sc backend
  OSC has timestamps, so SC can do scheduling.
* (notes -> score) is already written
