#+title: <2024-10-25 Fri> Every sundown the birds outside my office window go bonkers.
I'm on the ninth floor judging from other buildings (although it's called the fifth in mine).

I'm surprised they want to fly up this high. I wonder if they go all the way to the 41st. I think I looked around on the 25th floor and there was no evidence of birds stuck to the windows.

They look like they're playing, chasing each other, flying for no obvious reason. They dart singly, they dart in droves, they climb, they dive. Sometimes ten of them at once are within a few yards of my window.
