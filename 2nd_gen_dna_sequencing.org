#+title: 2nd Gen DNA Sequencing
"It spies on [[id:ee507cf3-a967-40b2-9c53-18ca7c484655][How DNA Is Copied]]."
* the process
** basically
Chops up the DNA into short single-strand subsets,
and puts them on a flat surface (billions on a single slide),
scattered randomly.
Then add DNA polymerase, and [[id:9648d682-4f6f-47f2-bd74-ed84f979d28c][terminated bases]].
Then take a photo.
Then cleave the terminators (leaving the once-terminated bases in place)
and repeat.
** a complication: strand amplification
Before the process runs, one makes a lot of copies of each strand,
clustered around that strand.
This is to ensure enough light to show up in a photo.
* potential error: adding a non-terminated base somewhere
** The problem
causes that strand to get "out of sync" with the others.
It will one position ahead of schedule if it received only one non-terminated base.
** The solution: [[id:d052fcbb-b2c5-4ec2-b460-62928059220a]["Base Caller" Software]]
* The reads will vary in length.
* Reads that "should" be identical can differ.
both due to sequencing error, and because of polyploidy --
the fact that sexual species contain two not-quite copies of each chromosome,
one from either parent.
