#+title: 37-edo
* judging it as a tuning
** amazing in no-3 13-limit
** Composing without perfect fifths seems like a useful exercise
 It's never occurred to me before but I wonder whether I use that interval as a kind of crutch. It's almost always present in my music, and my deviations from it are very 12-et: basically aug, dim and dom7 b5.
** Leaving out factors of 3, 37-edo will give me all the intervals I want, in exactly one form
 wide min 2nd (14:13)
 neutral 2nd (11:10)
 wide maj 2nd (8:7)
 min 3rd (13:11)
 neutral 3rd (16:13)
 the familiar major third (5:4)
 wide major third (14:11)
 super-narrow fourth (13:10, 454 cents)
 super-wide fourth (11:8)
 the familiar septimal tritone (7:5)
