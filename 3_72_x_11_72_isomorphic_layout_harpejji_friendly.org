#+title: 3\72 x 11\72 isomorphic layout (harpejji-friendly)
The harpejji uses 12-edo frets
and tunes adjacent strings 2\12 apart.
If you added quarter-tone frets (so now it's a 24-edo instrument),
since the interval between adjacent strings is so small,
it seems like an ideal instrument to try a skip-fret[1] tuning for 72-edo.

For instance, if you tuned the strings 11\72 apart
(11\72 being 1.84 halftones,
so just slightly narrower than the usual whole step),
you get a layout like this:

  Strings are vertical lines.
  This side is bassier.

   1  -  - 11  -  -  -
   -  -  -  -  -  7  -
  17  - 21  - 13  -  2
   -  -  -  3  -  -  -
   9  5  -  -  -  - 17
   -  -  -  -  -  -  -  Frets are horizontal lines.
  19  -  -  -  -  -  9  This right side is treblier
   -  -  -  - 15  -  -  (and the left side bassier).
   -  -  -  -  -  - 19
   - 23  -  -  -  -  -
   -  -  -  -  -  -  -
  11  -  -  -  -  -  -

  This side is treblier.

Just like on the harpejji, octaves span 6 strings,
although now they span an additional 1\12 (two frets of 24-edo).
And no interval requires you to reach across more than 5\12 = 10\24 frets.
(The equivalent figure for a 24-edo guitar in standard tuning is 9\24 frets.)
