#+title: 41-edo Chapman Stick tunings
  intended, ideal for these strings, my current compromise, and future
* PITFALL: Review [[id:d8863536-c1f1-4ad2-b974-967ecdb0087d][how to explore tunings]]
* All numerical notes are mod 41, where 0 = C.

* the data (input and output)
*** PITFALL: The [[id:b2210822-fb0b-4e68-a803-d1edfd7c4007][row-specific notes]] include calculations that the code was unable to make, needed for out-of-sample data.
*** the table
**** notes
***** PITFALL: pitches are recorded at the 12th fret!
      As long as I'm consistent it won't matter.
      But if I ever use this table to determine
      the gauge corresponding to an open string,
      I'll be off by a fifth (ratio of 3:2).
***** column interpretations
****** try-log
       is what the code suggests when I use logarithmic frequency interpolation.
****** try-lin
       is what the code suggests when I use linear      frequency interpolation.
****** The other column names are documented in the code.
***** the try-gauge column
      was created mostly automatically,
      from gauge.py. But for some out-of-sample strings, that strategy didn't work,
      so I just plugged in numbers myself. Those cases are described by the "notes"
      column and the "row-specific notes" org heading.

      (1) 21.1 = gauge 159.5 167.8 19.5 198.7 14.7
      (2) 22.8 unwound = gauge 151.6 167.8 19.5 198.7 14.7
      (3) 15.6   wound = gauge 151.6 137.0 24.1 123.8 33.5
          but that seems really thin for a wound string,
          and very far out of sample.
	  And indeed, Kalium's wound bass strings only go down to 24
	  (and their unwound plain bass strings only up to 23).
      (4) 20.5 unwound = gauge 162.2 167.8 19.5 198.7 14.7
      (5) I don't know whether John got a 19 or a 20,
          so I've left this at 19.5, which is what I requested.
**** TODO the next tuning

       I don't know what the true gauge being used here is --
       I asked for 19.5, which is unavailable and equidistant to 19 and 20.
****** (2) gauge 162.2 167.8 19.5 198.7 15 = 20.5 uw
****** (3) gauge 162.2 137   24   128   29 = 13 w, but the closest is a 21 w
****** (4) I guess this was part of my very old Stick strings?
