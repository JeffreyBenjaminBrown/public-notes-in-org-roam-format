#+title: 41-edo Chapman Stick tunings
  intended, ideal for these strings, my current compromise, and future
* PITFALL: Review [[id:d8863536-c1f1-4ad2-b974-967ecdb0087d][how to explore tunings]]
* All numerical notes are mod 41, where 0 = C.
* the code

* BLOCKED the data (input and output)
*** BLOCKED : I'm waiting on Kalium and/or Starrett to tell me what gauges I've got, after which I can make the data more precise.
*** PITFALL: The [[id:b2210822-fb0b-4e68-a803-d1edfd7c4007][row-specific notes]] include calculations that the code was unable to make, needed for out-of-sample data.
*** the table
try-log is what the code suggests when I use logarithmic frequency interpolation.
try-lin is what the code suggests when I use linear      frequency interpolation.
The other column names are documented in the code.

*** general notes
    the try-gauge column was created mostly automatically,
    from gauge.py. But for some out-of-sample strings, that strategy didn't work,
    so I just plugged in numbers myself. Those cases are described by the "notes"
    column and the "row-specific notes" org heading.
*** row-specific notes

    (1) 21.1 = gauge 159.5 167.8 19.5 198.7 14.7
    (2) 22.8 unwound = gauge 151.6 167.8 19.5 198.7 14.7
    (3) 15.6   wound = gauge 151.6 137.0 24.1 123.8 33.5
        but that seems really thin for a wound string,
        and very far out of sample.
	And indeed, Kalium's wound bass strings only go down to 24
	(and their unwound plain bass strings only up to 23).
