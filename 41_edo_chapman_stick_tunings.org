#+title: 41-edo Chapman Stick tunings
  intended, ideal for these strings, my current compromise, and future
* PITFALL: Review [[id:d8863536-c1f1-4ad2-b974-967ecdb0087d][how to explore tunings]]
* TODO I made *amazing* code for this.
  see of/tax.co/online/temp-freqs/
* All numerical notes are mod 41, where 0 = C.
* DONE ? my original intent
** interpreting the columns
   ideal = sounds / feels best with 12th fret tuned to
   Hz = my intent in Hz, at the nut
   gauge = what I asked John for, which supposedly is on there now
   intent = my intent in musical notation, at the 12th fret
   err 1 = error = intent - ideal
** the table
|  s | gauge  | ideal      | intent     | intent Hz | err |
|    |        | at fret 12 | at fret 12 |    at nut |     |

* the table
** interpreting the columns
   gauge     = what I asked John for, which supposedly is on there now
   ideal     = sounds / feels best with 12th fret tuned to
     i-note  = ideal note
     i-41    = ideal number of steps of 41-edo up from C
     i-Hz    = ideal frequency in Hz
   u	      = what I'm currently using
     u-note  = using note
     u-41    = using number of steps of 41-edo up from C
     u-Hz    = using frequency in Hz
   err	      = using - ideal.
     These numbers are positive where the string is fat / tense.
** the table
PITFALL: All these measurements are at the 12th fret.

** what to do with string 12
   It needs changing and is out of sample.
   The only data I have near that frequency is for unwound strings.
   I get
     gauge 151.6 198.7 14.7 167.8 19.5
     = 22.8
