#+title: 46-edo // cool or challenging pitch sets
* TODO [[id:7fa71293-fe2f-4ddd-af25-87f0a8aadccf][RESUME here]]
* I like 2-limping scales.
  I like scales with alternating step sizes.
* [[id:68aa693f-5eea-4c77-aef0-4c9996ebece8][harmonic half-diminished starts from harmonic 5]]
* [[id:29f64058-c7e5-48d0-a16f-c22d4ebd38a8][some intervals 7:6 plays well with]]
* [[id:fd013c9a-dfd5-4a1f-9de8-be19bb21daca][root, root minus sept m3, root minus sept M3]]
** [[id:da07b936-245d-4693-8f36-38a89f54b25c][[7:9, 6:7, 1] = [0,7,17] \ 46]]
* [[id:3e05334b-e737-4914-bbe6-aedf31e1b827][the sound from ~9\12 to ~13\12 can be improved]]
** [[id:ef2fb6af-3443-4aea-9e02-046ce03ad5aa][in 46-edo, use 5:3 + 9:7 = 13:6]]
* limping 3-then-9 diminished scales
  alternatives
** start with 3\46
   so 0 3 12 15 24 27 36 39
   The last note is then 39 = 9:5 = the wide m7.
   This includes one perfect fifth
   (aligned with the root),
   tons of 5:4 and 6:5,
   and a few 11:8.
** start with 9\46
   so 0 9 12 21 24 33 36 ?45
   Rather than that last 45\46, substuting 41\46
   (the pitch halfway from 36 to 46) sounds good.
* 10:9 chains up or down from root and fifth
  => neutral scales
* 11-lim dorian #4
  0 6 12 21 27 33 39
** modes
*** code to show modes
    myPrint $ [mode 46 [0,6,12,21,27,33,39] i | i <- [0..6]]
*** the modes
    [0,6,12,21,27,33,39]
    [0,6,15,21,27,33,40]
    [0,9,15,21,27,34,40]
    [0,6,12,18,25,31,37]
    [0,6,12,19,25,31,40]
    [0,6,13,19,25,34,40]
    [0,7,13,19,28,34,40]
** noteworthy
   No mode has a tritone [22-24].
   Each scale with 27 (3:2) also has 21 (11:8).
* TODO 9-tone
* septimal augmented: limping 10s and 7s
**** universe
***** two varieties, each of which has two fifths
***** there are surely other varieties of septimal augmented
      but maybe not with two fifths
** 10s then 7, which has an outer 44
   0 10 17 27 34 44
** 7s then 10s, which has an outer 41
   0 7 17 27
* walk up a short very major fourth
  not really a fourth (19) but it sounds like it when arpeggiated
  0 7 14 17

* 8 tone neutral scale with fourth and fifth
  has lots of fifths!
  stack of 5-then-9 with a correction from 26 to 27
* 6 tone aug scale with two fourths
  It feels like there are a lot of these but here's (a particularly harmonic?) one:
  0 10 15 27 32 42
* 5-tone 2-limping scale with a 15:8 and three 11:8s
  0 14 21 35 42
* two stacks of fifths, one with one slightly flat 3:2
  Every interval except the one divided by the '+' below
  is 3:2, except the one marked with a caret.

  0 27 8' 35' + 15 41 22

                 680c
* [0,5,12 \ 46] x [0,22 \ 46] + 44
  That is, two units of 0-5-12, almost a tritone apart.
  Since there's a little less than a tritone between them,
  there's room to begin (include the first note of) a third cycle,
  so the full scale is
  0 5 12 22 27 34 44
* neutral diminished with lots of perfect fifths
  The first three columns of this two-row table
  are all perfect fifths,
  every interval except at the + is 5\46,
  and there are two modes with [0,10,15,27],

  0   5 10 15 20 +
  27 32 37 42
