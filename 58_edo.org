** TODO Extend [[id:f0b6f2cc-c365-4463-99ce-a6092752e8fd][HEWM notation]] to include a 2\58 accidental.
*** why it needs extension
    81:80 = 64:63 = 1\58,
    so two of the four HEWM accidental distances are equal.
    In fact so is 65/64, which is the most obvious extension to the 13-limit
    (it's the distance between 16/13 and 5/4).
    But it seems worth introducing a new value equal to 2\58,
    like 27/26 (the difference between a Pyth sixth and 13/8).
*** TODO or maybe I don't understand [[id:35e37588-7a0a-4fe6-a355-60dcec62d47b][what makes a ratio vanish in an edo?]]
