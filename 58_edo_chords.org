   18\58 all the way up
* dom7
** 13-ish dom7 : 0 22 34 49
   49 - 22 = 27
   Sounds to me even better than [[id:8721ea2c-aa85-4fab-a755-1d5893228c36][0 21 34 49]].
** [[id:46905408-f047-4926-957f-ac01927e22c4][9-based dom7 chord]]

   That's dom7 with the 3rd and the 7th raised 2\58:
   0  21   34   49
   1  9:7  3:2  9:5
   [1,  9/7,  3/2,  9/5 :: Rational]
*** add 2\58 to the 3rd and 7th degrees of 4:5:6:7

    to get 1 : 9/7 : 3/2 : 9/5
    (And remember, [[id:297305db-3682-4373-b8bd-132b389cb1a4][9:5 sounds at least as good as 16:9]])
* diminished chords
** the [[id:532a43fe-68b9-4f74-a8c6-30bbff67a36c][two-quarters septimal diminished]] chord fits nicely in a just dom7
   Where the dom7 is rooted 6\58 below
   the top note of the neutral 3rd.
** the [[id:fb41534d-1f92-4eb1-b20f-45a96ff21d36][diminished Starling]] chord fits nicely in a dom7 tup3 tup7
   The root of the lone 7:6 is the third of the dom7 tup3 tup7
   (where tup7 means the usual 7th degree +2\58, and tup3 similarly)
** There's a diminished chord that's 13:8 wide in root position.
     13    15    13
   0    13    28    41
** 5-note diminished chords
*** uniform 11 & 15 h
    11th harmonic, 15th harmonic
      13    14    13    13
    0    13    27    40    53
	       11:8  ??    15:8
**** 39\58 and 41\58 have much simpler (8:5 and 13:8) representations than 40\58 does
*** 11 13 15 h : the most ? harmonic
      13    14    13    13
    0    13    27    41    53
	       11:8  13:8  15:8
* symmetric chords
** augmented
*** 19 + 21 + 18 > the other ordering
    = 5/4 + 9/7 + almost 5/4
    I'm not sure why I prefer this to the other but I seem to.
*** 19 + 22 + 17 = the haromic ordering
**** decompositions
     = (11/9 = 16/13)
     + 5/4
     + (13/10 = 17/13 = 22/17)
**** the JI identity
     ghci> (16/13) * (5/4) * (13/10)
     2.0
*** 19*2 + 20
** diminished Starling = 6/5*3 + 7/6 = 2
