#+title: 58-edo guitar strategy: 15\58 x {2\58 and 4\58}
* Use [[id:e5279156-0f56-4f92-83ff-de0b28b04c68][15\58 x 2\58]] for "the first octave".
  This implies a 29-edo fretboard.
  29-edo is too tight to use everywhere,
  but fine in the first octave.
* Use [[id:60af331b-3593-47af-ad78-21f1ee6ae281][15\58 x 4\58]] in "the second octave".
  This implies a 14.5-edo fretboard (58/4),
  which is easily playable in a guitar's second octave.
** The octave at string 2 fret 7 might look awkward
   but if this is only used in the second octave,
   it shouldn't be a problem --
   7 frets of 14.5-edo in the second octave is narrower than
   3 frets of 12-edo in the first octave.
* The transition does not have to be right at the octave.
  That's why I used quotation marks above.
  But in reality I should extend the 29-edo
  as far as I can stand it,
  and only use 14.5 edo for the rest of the fretboard.
* An octave fret will result without any tricky tinkering.
  Having an octave fret makes intonation adjustment easier.
  Since 2 divides 58,
  keeping only the even frets in the first octave
  ensures there will be an octave fret.

  (By contrast, on a 41-edo guitar,
  keepign the odd frets means you get fret 40 and 42,
  skipping the octave at 41.
  I wish I had kept the odd frets instead.)
* I suspect fret markers that repeat every 5 frets would be simplest.
  They could be more dense than every five frets --
  for instance, two dots on every fret equal to 0 mod 5,
  and one dot on each equal to 2 mod 5.
