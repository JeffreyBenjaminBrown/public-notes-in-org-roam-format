#+title: 58-edo scales, chords and harmonies
* see also [[id:bfe139e1-14a4-4538-82d4-ea11f142e0ce][just intonation]]
* TODO try a neutral aug-ish scale
** idea
   repeat [0, x] every 17\58
     for some value of x
** code
:{
filter (< 58) $
  take 12 $ -- way more than enough
  concat [ fmap (+x) $
           [0,4] | x <- [0,17..] ]
:}
* whole-tone scales
** the most harmonious
   [0, 28] x [0, 10, 19]
   That is, two clusters of [0,10,19]\58.
   offset by 28\58.
** 7 tones, ends at 54\58
   9\58 (182 cent) intervals all the way up.
   Includes the [[id:f5663e9e-0959-42df-8ca2-6290bad6c41b][4-note aug chord that includes 54\58]]
** septimal: 6 tones, ends at 53\58
*** definition
    diffs  : - 11 - 10 - 11 - 10 - 11 - 5
    values : 0,  11,  21,  32,  42,  53
*** why it's good
    it has two 7:8:9 triads (0 11 21 \ 58)
    and a 15:8 (53)
* 4-note aug chord including 54\58
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       f5663e9e-0959-42df-8ca2-6290bad6c41b
  :END:
  18\58 all the way up
* 9-tone dim scales
  Repeat 0 8 13 or 0 5 13.
** Starting with 8 => it includes 34\58.
** Both scales include 52\58.
** Both are uniform except where 5\58 and 6\58 meet.
* bichords a neutral seventh-(ish) apart
** 0 maj & -7' sept maj
   = 0 maj & 51 [0 21 34]
   = 0 19 34 51 14' 27'
** 0 maj & -7' sept min
   = 0 maj & 51 [0 13 34]
   = 0 19 34 51 6' 27'
** 0 min & -7' min
   = 0 15 35 51 8' 27'
** (0 min +42) & (-6 sept min)
   Here the minor third from 0 also serves
   as the septimal major third from -6.
* subharmonic series
** 1/[8..13,15] = 5-limit phrygian* but         16/13
   with 16/9, not 9/5
** 1/[8..14   ] = 5-limit phrygian* but 8/7 and 16/13
   with 16/9, not 9/5
* the [[id:532a43fe-68b9-4f74-a8c6-30bbff67a36c][two-quarters septimal diminished]] chord fits nicely in a just dom7
  Where the dom7 is rooted 6\58 below
  the top note of the neutral 3rd.
* the [[id:fb41534d-1f92-4eb1-b20f-45a96ff21d36][diminished Starling]] chord fits nicely in a dom7 tup3 tup7
  The root of the lone 7:6 is the third of the dom7 tup3 tup7
  (where tup7 means the usual 7th degree +2\58, and tup3 similarly)
* [[id:46905408-f047-4926-957f-ac01927e22c4][9-based dom7 chord]]
  That's dom7 with the 3rd and the 7th raised 2\58:
  0  21   34   49
  1  9:7  3:2  9:5
  [1,  9/7,  3/2,  9/5 :: Rational]
* add 2\58 to the 3rd and 7th degrees of 4:5:6:7

  (And remember, [[id:297305db-3682-4373-b8bd-132b389cb1a4][9:5 sounds at least as good as 16:9]])
* symmetric chords
** augmented
*** 19 + 21 + 18 > the other ordering
    = 5/4 + 9/7 + almost 5/4
    I'm not sure why I prefer this to the other but I seem to.
