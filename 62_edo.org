#+title: 62-edo
* harmonic theory
** 62-edo is a great flat system.
   Every harmonic from 2 through 31 is between .8c sharp and 9.4c flat.
** 62-edo beats 31-edo even restricting attention to the 13-limit.
   That's because its 13/8 is flat instead of sharp,
   both slightly closer to true and playing much better with the others.
* layouts
** good for guitar
*** TODO [[id:fc5d6b28-9d85-42cd-832e-82dbe5d51018][3\62 x 14\62 (isomorphic pitch layout)]]
** good for lumatone
*** TODO [[id:4103577a-3599-483a-989c-1e7bce1460b1][9\62r x 1\62u (isomorphic pitch layout)]]
*** TODO [[id:4adcc5d1-9ee4-435d-9055-e2496af8bb5a][6\62r x 7\62d (isomorphic pitch layout)]]
**** *Seems* to dominate [[id:70fcb19e-1573-439e-a1eb-b0747977e704][7\62r x 6\62d (isomorphic pitch layout)]]
     but I'm not sure -- arguably the 5-limit is easier in this one.
