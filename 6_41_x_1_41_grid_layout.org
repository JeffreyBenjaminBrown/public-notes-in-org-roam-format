#+title: 6\41 x 1\41 (grid layout for 41-edo)
* It's so linear!
  7:4 is perfectly off the root-octave axis.
  Everything else is within roughly 1 fret of the axis.
* On Lumatone, map horiz to horiz and vertical to vertical.
  Ordinarily I map the horizontal axis
  (the one that varies the "string")
  to the nearly-horizontal Lumatone axis,
  and the vertical axis (the one that varies the "fret")
  to the 45-degree Lumatone axis.
  But this layout is so short I could actually map it
  to the nearly-vertical Lumatone axis.
  Doing that makes the octaves a lot narrower.

  0  steps;  1 % 1; string 0; fret 0
  7  steps;  9 % 8; string 1; fret 1
  13 steps;  5 % 4; string 2; fret 1
  19 steps; 11 % 8; string 3; fret 1
  24 steps;  3 % 2; string 4; fret 0
  29 steps; 13 % 8; string 5; fret -1
  33 steps;  7 % 4; string 5; fret 3
