#+title: 72-edo
* Marvel-compatible = augmented chords are great!
  (15 / 8)    = (5/4) * (9/7) * (7/6),
    True in anything consistent in the 15-limit.
  (65 = 15/8) =     (23 = 5/4) + (26 = 9/7) + (16 = 7/6)
  (72 = 2/1)  = 2 * (23 = 5/4) + (26 = 9/7)
    This is an essentially tempered chord,
    special to 72 and a few others.
