Taking notes on the world is like fighting the ocean with a pocketknife. Any effort at it is so incommunicably, insurmountably, inevitably incomplete. I started these in January 2020 and only a few months ago introduced into the graph the concept of [[everyting][everything.org]].

Some of these notes are entirely practical -- how to solve some problem in some piece of software, for instance. Others are written with some vague intention of being surfed and accreted in a game of self-improvement, an aspiration to a rhythm. None of them attempts to describe a topic completely. In general I only record something if I think it will be useful to me personally -- facts I enjoy, and prompts for thinking.

If you think these are fun, and would like to work with me on [[a project to share ](shareable_knowledge_gardens.org)] such notes, hit me up! My email is in the git log.
