# These notes seem silly if not seen as the result of a process whose goal they are not.

The collection is four years old, and yet only four months ago a node representing [[everyting][everything.org]] was introduced. When I write something and remember that it belongs there, I might add it there, but most things might not even be reachable from there following hyperlinks.

Taking notes on the world is like fighting the ocean with a pocketknife. Any effort at it is so incommunicably, insurmountably, inevitably incomplete.

Some notes are entirely practical -- how to solve some problem in some piece of software, for instance. Others are written with some vague intention of being surfed and accreted in a game of self-improvement, an aspiration to a rhythm. None of these attempts to describe a topic completely. In general I only record something if I think it will be useful to me personally -- facts I enjoy, prompts for thinking, probably other kinds of things too, but no effort made at completeness for the topic itself.

# Join me. It's bliss.

If you think these are fun, and would like to work with me on [[a project to share ](shareable_knowledge_gardens.org)] such notes, hit me up! My email is in the git log.
