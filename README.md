# These include all the deepest thoughts I have come across.
Which is much greater than the collection I know. I try to write them in their most concise form. Some are my notes on someone else's writing.

But it also includes a lot of stuff I doubt anyone else can use -- largely plans and records. Not every file in this repo is necessarily interesting even to me now.

# Save time by reading top-down!

Github draws .org files with headings bigger than subheadings, which are bigger than sub-subheadings, etc. Each heading describes (although each in a different way) its subheadings. So if you see a heading you don't care about, then skip ahead to the next heading of the same size.

I hope they tried simply displaying the raw text and decided people understood it this way better. But if you're reading this online and would like the section/subsection/.. logic to be more explicit, you can click "Raw" in the upper-right corner to see that. Unfortunately, from that view the links won't work, so you might want to toggle back and forth.

## How to read the raw text

If a heading begins with N stars, it is a subsection of the most recent section with N-1 stars. Things with 1 star are subsections of the line near the top of the file that says "#+title: [document title here]".

# These notes seem silly if not seen as the result of a process whose goal they are not.

Each note serves some external goal, but their goals differ. My favorite ones aim to understand a high principle, like love.

Taking notes on the world is like fighting the ocean with a pocketknife. Any effort at it is so incommunicably, insurmountably, inevitably incomplete.

Some notes are entirely practical -- how to solve some problem in some piece of software, for instance. Others are written with some vague intention of being surfed and accreted in a game of self-improvement, an aspiration to a rhythm. None of these attempts to describe a topic completely. In general I only record something if I think it will be useful to me personally -- facts I enjoy, prompts for thinking, probably other kinds too.

# Join me. It's bliss.

If you think these are fun, and would like to work with me on [[a project to share ](shareable_knowledge_gardens.org)] such notes, hit me up! My email is in the git log.
