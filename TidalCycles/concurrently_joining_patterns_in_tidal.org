  On which side the bar lies determines which pattern divides time.
  If it's on both sides, both patterns divide time.
** The examples in the documentation are helpful.
   https://tidalcycles.org/docs/patternlib/tutorials/pattern_structure
** Two interesting operators: |> and <|
   They take values from one side but metric divisions from the other.
