   Read about control buses here.

   Brian Gold (@bgold)'s solution is the most general,
   but requires SC hacking.
   "accelerate" manipulates sample pitch.
   Something like "legato 1.1"
   helps to fix the gaps between notes using "accelerate".

*** for me to process
    "Control buses" let me slide notes, according to @polymoprhic.engine:

    d1 $ s "theremin" # freqbus 0 (segment 128 $ smooth "200 200 300 300")
*** for me to respond
    What makes a bassline acid is mostly timbre, not notes.

   Route two signals into the same effects chain.
