#+title: dividing patterns in Tidal
* iter :: Pattern Int -> Pattern a -> Pattern a
** the idea
   `iter n` divides the pattern into `n` pieces,
   and first plays them in order,
   then in order but starting on the 2nd, etc.
** [[id:e6b5b9c2-7b00-4c64-9096-1b3ca6712cf0][fugue from superimposing a transposed iter on a panning arpeggio]]
* iter' :: like iter but starts at 0, then n-1, n-2, etc.
