#+title: what sounds good in TidalCycles
* Waves of differing durations in a steady hat pulse.
  s "hc*8" |*| slow 2 (amp "1 0.3")
           |*| slow 4 (speed "1 1.3 1.5") ]
* A super wrong-pitched bass drone under something familiar
  e.g. 10.4\12 under a i-IV
* TODO hypotheses to test
** collect changes
*** determine "I want it to sound more (complex, energetic, punchy, moody) and then make a *lot* of changes to that effect before executing any
** overwrite timbres
*** code example
    const "supersquare" <$> "bd sn"
*** elaboration
    Keep one or two main rhythms, the bd-sn and hh patterns.
    Use them in many voices by overwriting the sample.
** define some shared modulation curves as patterns
   The duration (via slow) of each should be defined.
   Use these "global" modulation curve to coordinate changes different voices.
