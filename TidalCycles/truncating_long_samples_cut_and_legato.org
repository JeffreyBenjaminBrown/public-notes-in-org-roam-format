#+title: truncating long samples : `cut` and `legato`
* cut n = assign to cut group n (which can be shared with other samples)
** simplest demo
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
d1 $ fast 2 $ sound "bev" # cut 1
#+end_src
** interactions
#+begin_src haskell
  do setcps 1
     d1 $ stack [
       (1/3) <~ (slow 4 $ sound "pebbles ~" |* cut 1),
       slow 2 $ sound "bev ~" # cut 1
	 |*| slow 4 (speed $ run 4 / 2 + 0.5),
       ( slow 2 $ every 2 (fast 2 . (<~) (1/4)) $ fast 2 $
	 palindrome $ s "[bd bd*2]/2 sn:1*2" )
       ]
#+end_src
*** TODO Question: How are conflicts resolved?
    If two samples trigger at the same time,
    which should sound?
* legato
  Unlike cut groups, legato can result in overlap or gaps.
** two inconsistent descriptions
*** legato is the "amount of overlap between two adjacent synth sounds. Values less than one (e.g. 0.5) will cut the sound off sooner. Values greater than one (e.g. 1.5) will cut the sound off later"
    https://tidalcycles.org/docs/reference/audio_effects/
*** legato n = play for n cycles -- JBB
** example
 #+begin_src haskell
   d1 $ stack [ speed 2 |*| sound "bev ~ bev ~" # legato 8,
		speed 0.5 |*| slow 4 (sound "bev ~ bev ~") # cut 1 ]
 #+end_src
