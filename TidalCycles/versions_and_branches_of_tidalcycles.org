#+title: versions and branches of TidalCycles
  These notes were taken around <2023-11-24 Fri>.
* useful Bash snippet
  git log | grep 1.8.1 -C 5
* each time I have to cherry-pick my changes from jbb-polite
  git cherry-pick 476d3effe5725b11ec045594c768d6ba90d2a861
* I'm trying 1.8.2
  1.8.2 = 860a480adbf9073b3fbeb686293ffef14f98a719
  git checkout 860a480adbf9073b3fbeb686293ffef14f98a719
  git branch 1.8.2-jbb-polite
* I could not get 1.7.10 to work.
** how it failed
   Even after disabling a lot of stuff (tests, benchmarks, git repository) in `tidal.cabal` it still said that, `cabal` complains:
     After searching the rest of the dependency tree exhaustively, these were the goals I've had most trouble fulfilling: template-haskell, pretty, text, tidal-parse
** why and how I tried it
   I'm trying 1.7.10, which,
   if I'm reading the git log correct, is commit
     c1c16cde0c83a2b9afeaaed05a8a0d64d9a7dd6b
   @mvdirty recommnded 1.9-dev,
   but Tidal.Transitions doesn't work in that one.
   That's because the changelog
     https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tidal-1.9.4/changelog
   mentions transitions in 1.7.10.
   After 1.7.10 comes 1.8.0,
   which makes me suspect 1.7.10 is stabler.
