#+title: voices, long samples and signal flow in Tidal
* voice names
** There are some "preassigned voices".
   `d1`, for instance.
   See BootTidal.hs for their definitions.
*** PITFALL: [[id:2b81a68f-cfa5-45fc-b61e-3db738463018][Preassigned voices also have voice names.]]
** Voice names can be dynamic and informative.
   Rather than use the preassigned voice names like `d1`,
   one can name patterns as in
     p 1
   or
     p "juliet"

* mute, solo, umute, unsolo
  `mute 1` mutes `d1` (which is a synonym for `p 1`).
  `solo` is similar.
