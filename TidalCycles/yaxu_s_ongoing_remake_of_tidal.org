#+title: Yaxu's ongoing remake of Tidal
* TODO Suggest "serial" and "parallel" instead of "stack" and "cat".
* TODO Ask: What is StackSteps for?
  Subsequence is clearly for the serial relationship,
  and StackCycles is for the concurrent relationship.
  What else is there?
* TODO What are parts and wholes?
  Go through Tidal (not Tidal2) and find places where `whole`
  is used non-trivially.
* How do parts, wholes and cycles interact?
