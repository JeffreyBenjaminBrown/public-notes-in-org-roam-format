** what it looks like
   Lumatone into Ardour will stop producing noise when this happens.
   Did it go away after I turned off Dim Screen and Screen Energy Saving
   under Settings -> Energy Saving -> On AC Power?
** the underlying problem
*** At least this time <2022-09-28 Wed>, it was [[id:db6ef5ff-4276-4bbd-b008-4c1db7255e27][a bad USB cable]].
** the solution
   Use a better USB cable, throw out the bad one.
