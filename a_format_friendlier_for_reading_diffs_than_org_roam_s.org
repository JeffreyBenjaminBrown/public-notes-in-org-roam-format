#+title: a format friendlier for reading diffs than org-roam's
* the idea
** Each file is a flat org-file.
   Flat = only level-1 headlines.
** Headlines can be
   alternatives
*** plain text
*** links to another file F "in" the host file H

    Such a file F extends the view from H,
    and is not necessarily meaningful outside of the context of F.
    If a yet further nested file G is a child of F,
    I that file too should be considered to be "in" H, not F.
*** links to another stand-alone file.
** The view from standalone file F

   transcludes through all of the files "in" it.
* Downside: This makes the org files hard to read without special software.
  It's not rocket science, but it's tedious:
  [[id:228029c2-ea1c-4f18-b5e4-975989fca3be][The view from standalone file F]] can require traversing more files than F itself.
* Motivation: Why this makes diffs easy to read.
  Each move is just a single insertion-deletion pair,
  rather than a whole lot of contiguous
* Question: What's a good term for [[id:54f597a8-c9ea-4873-8385-22e82c9d9de6][files "within" files]]?
