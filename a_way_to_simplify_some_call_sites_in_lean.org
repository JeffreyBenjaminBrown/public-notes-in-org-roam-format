#+title: a way to simplify some call sites in Lean

* AntC2 described this problem
```
def length (α : Type) (xs : List α) ...

... => Nat.succ (length α ys)
```

Whether or not an explicit binding point for the α in the signature would be useful (Haskell has forall), why the f*** would I want to encumber every call to length with a type application when length‘s argument ys gives the type?
* and Ei30metry responded with a solution
You can make α an implicit parameter by wrapping it inside curly-braces instead of parenthesis.

```
def myLength {α : Type} (xs : List α) :=
  match xs with
    | []      => 0
    | _ :: ys => 1 + myLength ys
```
