#+title: absurdity & privacy
* The majority of absurd content is imagined and not expressed.
* Even for shared absurdity, interpretations and reactions vary much more widely than for more common phenomena.
  And much of those interpretations and reactions
  are inexpressible, even if we had time to try.
