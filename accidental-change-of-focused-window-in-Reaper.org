#+title: accidental change of focused window in Reaper
* TODO [[id:b5a704f4-384a-41dc-941c-8878850b4302][Can the focused window always be on top? \ Reaper]]
* the problem
  Sometimes focus switches to the arrange (main) view,
  but the MIDI editor stays in front of it.
* how to detect where the focus is
  alternatives
** cursor movement
   If in the MIDI editor,
   pressing left or right moves the cursor by a few pixels,
   rather than a grid unit,
   it's probably [[id:ea1beefe-1ad4-44fc-b883-58d049b3e5c3][because focus is on the arrange view]].
** shade of title bar
   It's brighter when it's *not* in focus.
* how to switch focus
** good way
   alternatives
*** Alt-Tab
*** clicking the title bar
** bad way
   Clicking inside the window works too,
   but has the side effect of moving the cursor in time.
