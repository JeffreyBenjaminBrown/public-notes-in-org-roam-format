#+title: add a key-value pair to an HTML form without showing the user
* the code
  <input type="hidden" name="subsample" value="1" />
* the idea
  Most of the form's inputs will be of types like "radio",
  i.e. UI elements.
  The "hidden" input just adds a key-value pair to the form,
  without even letting the user know.
