#+title: After filing something, know the whole note it went into.
* clarification & elaboration
  i.e. if you haven't read one of the files linking into where you just wrote, do so.
* why
  Otherwise I might be building up pointless notes --
  either wasting my time by writing things I won't read,
  or wasting my time by not reading valuable things.
* arguments over it
** CON: maybe just a volume thing
   This might be good mostly because it increases the volume read,
   and other graph strategies for doing that would be as effective.
** PRO: looking containerward is natural when unfocused
   But if you're somewhere and feeling aimless, then looking containerward,
   into the files that justify the current one's existence,
   does seem like a natural response.
** PRO: polite if sharing notes
   Which, in a sense with one's past selves, one always is.
