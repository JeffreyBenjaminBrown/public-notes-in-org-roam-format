#+title: After filing something, know the whole note it went into.
* definition | clarification
  i.e. if I haven't read it recently, read it.
* why
  Otherwise I might be building up pointless notes --
  either wasting my time by writing things I won't read,
  or wasting my time by not reading valuable things.
