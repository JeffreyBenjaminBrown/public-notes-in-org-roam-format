#+title: agumented 7th chords based on 9:11:13 (harmonic dorian)
Interestingly, none of these chords has a 5:4,
but they all sound closer to augmneted than anything else to me
(Jeff Brown).
Some of the intervals are listed below in terms of cents.

The central triad in all three chords is 7:9:11,
but each uses a different 7th degree,
to come as close as possible to aug7
(without straying into high harmonics).

The inversions:
7  : 9  : 11 : 13 ~ aug #7
9  : 11 : 14 : 16 ~ aug 7
11 : 14 : 18 : 20 ~ aug ^7

The thirds:
9  : 7  ~ 435 cents
11 : 9  ~ 347 cents
14 : 11 ~ 418 cents

The sevenths:
16 : 9  ~ 996 cents
20 : 11 ~ 1035 cents
13 : 7  ~ 1072 cents
