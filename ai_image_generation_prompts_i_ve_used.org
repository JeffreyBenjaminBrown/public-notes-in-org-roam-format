#+title: AI image generation prompts I've used
* u <2024-02-19 Mon>
** A muted, dusky pile of abstract houses and offices, expressionistic twisting flying roads and chunky cubist auto parts. They bend and flow into each other as if they were a dreamlike fluid. From the.flowing pile grow three big, vivid, natural trees.Climbing the pile, as if they were bouldering or surfing, are four giant, lanky, yellow, androgynous humanoids -- two male and two female. The style of the urban fluid chaos pile is cubist, expressionistic, surreal, warped -- but the trees and the giant humanoids are realistic.
** On the bottom left side of the image, standing on its hind legs, a tiny mouse looks diagonally out across a sunny landscape: desert, forests, mountains, cities and roads, the sea in the distance to one side. Amid a few wispy cirrus clouds hanga a small, strange red and green alien planet. Near the mouse are three tiny objects: a single sea shell, a single penny, and a single mushroom.
** A climber has reached the top of a cliff, and is pulling himself over the corner of the edge. Both hands hold the corner and one leg is over it; the other leg pushes off the rock below. The climber is anatomically correct. Below him is a strange abstract sea of architecture and swirling mechanisms. On the right, the sky and the top of the mountain are sunny, natural, and realistic. On the left, the swirling polygonal ocean below is cubist and bizarre.
** A barefoot free climber in shorts dramatically hangs from the top corner ledge of a cliff, hugging its surface.  Below is a surreal.roilingnocean of cubist architecture and mechanisms. In the foreground, the climber, cliff and vegetation are realistic, bright, sunnt. The flat top of the cliff has lush vegetation. Below, in the background, the ocean is abstract, expressionistic,  polygonal, dark. The sky is clear and spectacular.
** One climber helps another over the edge of a cliff. The climber above lies flat and extends an arm over the edge, grasping the hand of the lower climber, who hangs close to the cliff face. The.climbers and the cliff are realistic, but the background is a surreal, cubist, burning architectural tsunami against the night sky.
** A woman pulls a man up over the edge of the cliff. The woman lies flat on her belly on top of the cliff, her arm reaching over the side to grasp the hand of the man, who hangs vertically over the side. The man hugs the cliff face, his shoes finding scarce purchase, his left arm reaching straight up to grasp the woman's hand, his right hand grasping the rocks, his shoes finding scarce purchade against the cliff face rocks. Their faces are serious, concentrated. The people and the cliff in the foreground are realistic, but the flaming tidal.wave in the background is expressionistic, surreal, cubist.
** The style is dramatic, realistic. The sky is mostly clear, with a few wispy clouds, and a vast sunny windswept desert in the background. On top of a sheer cliff face, an older female climber lies flat on her belly, her arm reaching over the side of the cliff to grasp the hand of a younger woman who is struggling to to climb the side. The older woman pulls the younger woman up over the edge of the cliff.
* climber (this prompt was fantastic but then I mangled it)
  Please generate one image:

  In the foreground, a female climber hangs from the corner edge of a sunny mountain cliff. She pulls herself up over the lip and onto the top of the cliff, her athletic body hugging close to its face, the soles of her feet pressed against it for grip. Far below is a highly abstract, cubist, expressionist town -- swirling wavy polygonal houses, cars and trees, all bending and tumbling like a psychedelic ocean.
  The contrast is important -- there should be a clear separation between foreground and background. In the foreground, the realistic climber climbs a realistic rock face -- but in the background the city is a surreal twisted chaos.

* abstract gray saxophonist in desert
** TODO simpler
  The scene is a dull, drab, flat desert at sunset, low hills and a raised, empty highway in the distance. An abstract gray human in a suit stands in the foreground lower left corner facing right, blowing into a trumpet. A riotous stream of colorful 3-dimensional shapes pours from the bell of the trumpet, spreading out diagonally across the image. The musician leans backward, almost falling over, propelled backward by the stream. Under the stream, a single meerkat stands upright, watching the musician and clapping its tiny hands.
** complex
   The scene is a dull, drab, flat desert at sunset, low hills and a raised, empty highway in the distance. An abstract gray human in a suit stands in the foreground lower left corner facing right, blowing into a trumpet. As if it were a cornucopia, from the trumpet's bell tumbles a collection of colorful, diverse objects: dice, dirigible, pineapple, ballerina, warhorse, plunger, pink high heeled shoes. The riotous stream of diverse objects spreads from the trumpet's wide bell upward and to the right, and contrasts sharply with the drab desert and dimming sky. The musician leans back, almost falling over, propelled backward by the stream. Under the stream, a meerkat stands upright, watching the musician and clapping its tiny hands.
* lounging gods
** fishing & cell
   At twilight on a still lake floats a canoe. A man in the boat relaxes with his fishing rod, looking at his cell phone. From the sky above, a goddess watches the man critically. She holds a beam balance in her left hand and some broccoli in her right hand. The dimming sky is fiery orange, and the lake is a calmer purple.
** fishing & tv
   At twilight on a still lake float two objects: a small fishing boat and a television. A man in the boat relaxes with his fishing rod, watching the TV. The TV screen displays a boxing match. From the sky above, a goddess watches the man critically. She holds a beam balance in her left hand and some broccoli in her right hand. The dimming sky is fiery orange, and the lake is a calmer purple.
** desk
   Below, a healthy, middle-aged man in a bathrobe reclines on his couch. He watches the TV, which displays a chicken on the screen. In the sky above, a goddess watches the man critically. She holds a beam balance in one hand. and holds a stalk of broccoli like a club in her other hand. In the background a reddish-purple galaxy streaks across the black sky.
** fractals are hard
   At the bottom center of the image is a small Mandelbrot Earth -- a blue and green fractal with ocean, continents, mountains, etc. Floating above it, four men and women in white robes lounge on clouds, eating grapes, playing the lute and watching the Mandelbrot Earth grow below them. In the background a reddish-purple galaxy streaks across the otherwise black sky.
** boring
   In the sky high above the cliffs of a verdant mediterranean shore, on the left, a Greek man in a white robe lounges on a cloud, playing the lute. On the right, across from him on another cloud, a Greek woman reads a scroll. Between them flies a baby holding a bundle of arrows. The style is realistic, heroic.
* fire nurse
  A nurse in a Red Cross cap and hospital overalls fires of flamethrower against the wall of a damp, dark cave.
* veggie car
  Scientists in a laboratory are building an automobile made out of vegetables. One wheel is missing, one door is off, the vegetable engine is exposed. It is a vegan car, made from fruits, vegetables, legumes, tubers, nuts, avocado.
* book travel
  A girl in a long dress and backpack, reading a book, flies forward and rightward through the sky.  In the bottom left of the image, the place she leaves is rocky and barren, full of cliffs and volcanoes. At the top right, the place she jumps toward is verdant and lush, with an ocean, birds and a green city. Below her a train runs in the same direction as she is jumping, from the cliffs to the lush place. A red galaxy streaks across the night sky.
