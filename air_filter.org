#+title: air filter, homemade
A quieter, more effective DIY air purifier.
* TODO try taping only the joins
  With enough hands,
  there's no need to tape along the top and bottom.
* in brief
  Cut a hole in some cardboard. Sit a duct fan on top of it, blowing up, pulling air up through the hole. Sit that whole thing on top of a tower of four filters tied or taped together somehow.

   This is my favorite source. He doesn't just describe how to make it, but why it's both more effective and cheaper than the best commercial air filters. (It's actually slightly less effective at particles less than 2.5 micrometers across, but integrating over all particle sizes it's much better.)

   Here they use a giant box fan and huge filters, which I imagine is noisy -- at least, my experience with box fans suggests that. But they demonstrate the idea perfectly.
** what I buy
   Four filters for $40, something like this:

   (That looks like what I buy but the dimensions don't match the image -- in photos the filter is square, but the dimensions say it's 13" by 5". The actual model I've been buying appears no longer to be on Amazon.)
   Adjustable speed (important for quiet!) duct fan:
