* goals
** Share a scale.
** Share a beat structure.
** Share a theme, with per-instrument lensing.
   The simplest lens would be octave transposition.
   Will probably want to reuse lenses from melody to drums,
   since they will be tedious to write.
** Share a transformation.
   Shared scale transformations will be easiest.
   Shared beat structure transformations, likely next easiest.
   Shared theme transformations seem hard.
** HARD: Avoid melodic collisions.
   Playing the same note across two voices is actually okay,
   but notes that differ by one scale step are often not.
