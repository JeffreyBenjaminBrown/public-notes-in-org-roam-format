#+title: aliases in skg
* DONE permit saving aliases
** DONE use Optional for SkgNode::aliases
*** how it is interpreted
    Some( [] ) obliterates preexisting data;
    None leaves it unchanged.
*** implementation
    OrgNode and SkgNode should both change aliases to optional.
** DONE before putting a SkgNode S through update_fs_and_dbs, compare it to what's on disk
   If nothing is on disk, use it as is.
   If something D with the same id is on disk,
   then the Some fields in S should clobber those in D,
   but the None fields should have no effect on D.
   That is, use S / D, where the x/y operation
   replaces only the some fields of y with those from x.
* DONE heralds-mode: render 'type:aliases' as ALIASES
* DONE insert a branch from disk into a file, without re-rendering the entire file
  for this the cursor position as an integer can be saved,
  rather than associated to an id
* DONE permit the user to fetch aliases for the current heading
* DONE group title (alias) search results by common id
** title search over aliases should return id, title pairs, sort results on (id, title) in that order, and present both or group aliases as org-children of IDs so that it's visibly clear whether any two search results go to the same or different places
