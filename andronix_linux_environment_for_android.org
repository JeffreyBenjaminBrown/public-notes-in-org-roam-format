* The graphical environment does not seem to work.
  I've been starting it with vncserver-start
  VNC serves a graphical environment
  that can be read from a remote desktop app.
  Running the command seems to bring me into Ubuntu,
  nested within Termux.
  I've then been using Emacs from inside that Ubuntu,
  rather than using the GUI.
  It runs for a little while, then crashes.
  But I don't need it anyway.
* to start it
  From Termux, run ./start-andronix.sh.
  "Start Ubuntu XFCE Modded OS by running ./start-andronix.sh."
