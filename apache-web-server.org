#+title: Apache (web server)
* Apache is a web server
* some commands
** to start Apache
*** run `service apache2 start`
 or, in a tax.co Docker container, from /etc/apache2, run
   ./start-apache.sh
**** Otherwise I get the error that `DefaultRuntimeDir` is not set.
  In the default apache2.conf file, there's this line:
    DefaultRuntimeDir ${APACHE_RUN_DIR}
  but APACHE_RUN_DIR is not set,
  and it's nowhere in code for the official Apache docker `httpd` image.
** to show version: `apache2 -v`
* some paths
** logs are at /var/log/apache2
* Apache config
** PITFALL: Comments in Apache config files
 cannot trail code on the same line,
 although they can trail whitespace.
 (This is at least true for `ports.conf`.)
** PITFALL: Apache configuration for Debian is nonstandard
*** where it's documented
**** offline (in the Docker container), see this
  /usr/share/doc/apache2/README.Debian
**** online, search for "Debian" here:
 https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/httpd/DistrosDefaultLayout
*** rather than `httpd.conf,` it uses `apache2.conf` *and* `ports.conf`
** are mostly located at /etc/apache2
at least in my docker container
** what I customized
Everything below "jbb" in apache2.conf
** TODO ? PITFALL: might need more customization

*** add Apache language prefs in Docker container
**** Some of the docs recommend including this
in /etc/apache2/envvars:

     # jbb-added, to ensure Unicode compatibility, per docs here:
     #   https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/howto/deployment/wsgi/modwsgi/
     export LANG='en_US.UTF-8'
     export LC_ALL='en_US.UTF-8'
**** But I already have something similar
in the Docker container. It specifies "UTF-8" for both options;
it just leaves out the "US" part.
