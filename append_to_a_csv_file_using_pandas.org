#+title: append to a CSV file using Pandas
* PITFALL
  Pandas doesn't verify that the
  old data and the new addition are like-formatted.
  If the original has an index or doesn't,
  the new part likewise should or shouldn't.
* code
  x.to_csv (
    "x.csv",
    mode = "a", # append
    header = False )
