#+title: Ardour (DAW)
* MIDI in to Ardour on Linux
** takes a little QJackCtl configuration
  Ardour says that to use JACK, must disable "ALSA Sequencer Support"
  in QJackCtl under Setup > Misc:
  https://manual.ardour.org/setting-up-your-system/setting-up-midi/midi-on-linux/
** requires a2jmidid
   This creates red MIDI ports corresponding to the purple MIDI Through ports.
   In QJackCtl's graph, connect the Lumatone to the purple MIDI THrough.
   Then connect the red MIDI Through, which now has the same signal,
   to Ardour.
   (I could maybe instead connect the a2jmidid output to Pianoteq in Ardour.)
