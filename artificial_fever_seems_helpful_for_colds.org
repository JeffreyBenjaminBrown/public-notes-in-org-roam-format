#+title: Artificial fever seems helpful for colds.
* definition
  "Artificial fever" is too extreme a term, but something more precise would be harder to remember. I merely kept myself just under the threshold for sweating for a couple days.
* theoretical argument
  Various sources online say that viruses have a hard time reproducing at the high end of human body temperatures.
* my experience
  I seemed to recover faster than I normally do.
  In particular I skipped the usually later (last?)
  congested-lungs phase.
