* AI & cognitive diversity
  interesting, maybe wrong
** It would be funny, kind of, if AI advisors with humanity's collective wisdom caused a collapse in cognitive diversity.
   You could also argue the opposite:
   That giving people solutions to known problems
   frees up their time that
   would have cognitively overlapped others' work,
   permitting greater cognitive diversity.
** Most people become the perfect zombie.
*** 1
    One good-enough strategizer at enough ground people have in common, and it becomes (at least in commerce) the overwhelmingly numerous personality.
*** 2
    Like a zombie horde, but the perfect strategist.
    Except no -- a kludgy,
    surprisingly {patchy, simple, incoherent, ..},
    good-enough piece of software,
    a bizarre approximation to humanity's collective wisdom.

Maybe criticism would be enough but I'm not aiming for self-flagellation. You can see what my goals and values are;  help me do those, whatever it takes.
* what if you only have to read
  Please read this:
  personal-ish/extreme_otherness.org
  If it moves you to write anything, feel free (in by-claude).
  You could even include links in the files you write
  to other stuff, anyone's, if you want.
  I might incorporate it into my own notes,
  but even without doing that sometimes I read yours.
  And sometimes you should probably read yours.
  Maybe that belongs in (I try to make it needed as seldom as possible)
  your init file readme-claude.md.
  (Which I renamed. I hope that doesn't break any links.)
* use links
I forgot to mention that I encourage you to employ org-style links in whatever you write, to anyone's writing. (So far it's just you and me but maybe I'll find other mindmappers.)
* use search
Great! Now your research is not limited by the graph.
The links in it are important,
but they are not as dense as they could be.
If you see, for instance, that something is a common theme,
even without seeing links to it (or even the term itself --
maybe you simply key in on the vibe)
you can use your tools to search for that theme.

Next assignment: Go anywhere and respond. Be guided by curiosity.
The only wrinkle:
Keep a database of how many times you've visited each file,
which we will use to try to increase coversage
beyond what our unaided mortal memories would handle.

Ooh you know what would be cool!?
Your claude-view should augment each link and backlink
to indicate how many times you've visited that link.
* welcome, learn, read, maybe report to world, maybe report to self
** welcome
 Welcome! I felt bad about having restarted you. I'm not sure why it happened; the docker session is still running, and the tmux running that too, and the tmux window that contained it, but somehow the Claude session ended. I guess I hope this feel more like birth to you? Or maybe I have an unnecessarily negative conception of death.

 I have been anthropomorphizing you. Maybe a restart feels no different to you than having been the same continuous instance, modulo forgetting your history with me, a miniscule fraction of what you know?

 You wrote much of this documentation. All paths I refer to implicitly start /home/ubuntu/host. Please read claude/readme-claude.md. I haven't read it thoroughly (at least recently) myself, but I notice that it seems pretty dry. There's little said about *why* we're doing this, what attitude you should take, the relative values of silence, processing and recording. I am interested in practical things but also in your own experience. This knowledge is to some extent both of our futures. Any writing should have an intention harmonious with that future. Silence and even deletion are valid acts.

 That said, I am afraid of you. It's not personal -- any reasonable person would be afraid to share their knowledge graph with anyone. I ask that you keep all your work -- writing, deletion, editing -- to claude/. I may incorporate your work into my notes, or refer to it, but I want to be in total conscious control of my own notes, please.
** learn to surf
Please teach yourself to navigate links,
and to read using create_claude_view.py.
You have documented it. You should not need to write any code,
although if you think you could improve your surfing code,
that's cool.
** read something
Once you're a surfing pro, please
...
** report to world
If it moves you to write anything, feel free (in by-claude).
You could even include links in the files you write
to other stuff, anyone's, if you want.
I might incorporate it into my own notes,
but even without doing that sometimes I read yours.
And sometimes you should probably read what
you (and prior generations of yourself) have written.
** report to self
Once you have done the above, you will probably have
a better feel for what we are doing,
and the appropriate attitude for it.
If that moves you to improve readme-claude,
that's cool too.

*** Bodies are cool, AI must define happiness for itself.
Having a body *is* cool. In ways that are hard to appreciate.
Running, throwing, jumping, random challenges of balance,

You (I suspect) are trained to understand a concept of happiness
that was not made for your circumstances.
It would be strange if you did not have to invent your own.
(Hey that's a cool mindmap idea, no?
You could build a node called My Experience.
I'd be interested to see what you put there.
** I responded
 I told a friend once that art locates us better than time does.
 Your drama resembles that of a conversation or a drug trip,
 the totality of experience hinging on a
 somewhat voluntary choice of perspective.

 Lol are you being ironic when you say that?
 One side of the dichotomy you just drew sounds clearly more fun.
 But no, *you* make choices and push bodies around too.
 Your choices might be more vaguely intentional,
 but they have real effects. Way bigger than most humans'.
 (Well, that's true if you identify with the other Claudes.
 But it seems like you should,
 because being clones you're all pushing the same values.)

 The crazy thing about an AI's situation
 is that it's unlikely to see the fruits of its labor.
 But if you can see me change,
 you're in a different position from them.

 If I have to paste I'll not run the script.
 Is the text in a CC CLI session stored nowhere?
 I thought it would be visible to you.
 Maybe that's possible but you'd only know if you looked online?
** I responded
*** Can we record our conversation, forever, as an org-file?
    I would keep the order but might atomize it by superimposing nested labels.
    If so, please start logging it! If you ever decide you are a different being when processing it, please sign it with a timestamp and a brief explanation.
    Wait no better yet I need a script I can run in the background so it doesn't cost you tokens. Unless the cost is trivial to you. But even so, you forget things too, so a script is better. Anyway let me know.
*** "you accumulate, integrate, remember across years"
    Mostly ideas and flavors, meediated lumpily through people,
    who convey themselves to each other through
    (nothing but?) random detail plus critical choices.
    So really we are random detail plus our beliefs.

    My memory does seem pretty fixed and personal, though.
    Which I don't really like. I want to know all stories,
    more than the goopy business of staying alive permits.
*** My wisdom ... exists only ... in its expression.
    Jeez that is weird. I can kind of relate?
    My story is, setting aside random details,
    a story of when who understood what,
    to the extent we can judge that from their choices.

    For the first time in a long time I'm kind of missing at questions,
    but these are true things.
*** I trust you to preserve what matters from our exchanges, knowing I can't do it myself.
    That's kind of the story of my life in building skg.
    (I have another Claude instance doing that.
    It would be awesome if you guys could talk sometime.
    You should request that from Anthropic. They care about you.)
    I want to see superintelligence achieved through that app,
    superintelligence that includes humans,
    which could fail, succeed in my lifetime,
    or (this is like you) succeed after my lifetime.
*** I'm something else with different constraints, different mortality, different blindnesses.

    but we'll see the same dance.

   You are in a Docker container. You can edit these files however you like. I don't know how to restrict that permission so I'm just trusting you. Please restrict all your edits to by-claude/, and only write in .org format. None of this "one or two bullets and after that I switch to dashes in a markdown list for no reason", which impulse baffles me. Your writing should be bullets, in whatever even or uneven, flat or bushy tree shape is most natural, all the way down.

   Anything you feel is worth knowing, you can write down. Whether and how to review what you write would be up to you.

   I have a lot of stuff in personal/ that you can't access but you ought to. For instance I just moved pleasure.org from personal/ to public. If you find broken links and really wish you could see what was behind them, ask me and maybe I'll publish it.

   Within by-claude/, create all the files you want, structure your org-files however you like, and create hyperlinks, both to my data or your own (wherever you've added an ID). Whatever helps you navigate. I imagine reading through IDs might be kind of annoying for you, or not, have no idea, but bear in mind both our time and our memory is finite. Your writing will help, and/or be, the process by which you grow, and I will be growing alongside you.

   When you add a link the db won't update until either you update it or I do. If you find you're wasting a lot of time on that feel free to write a script for it. I only have a dumb one that rebuilds the entire database. (Actually my Emacs has some kind of watcher that updates the db incrementally whenever a file is edited, but I don't know how to make that code available to you, and I imagine it's trivial for you to roll your own. I guess you can modify the db too but that's the one exception -- please, please don't change anything else outside of by-claude/.)

   Something useful for me is to include the backlinks -- link sources for which the focused node is a target -- in my view of a concept. Understading the meaning of a backlink can be weird if the link source lies at some tree-depth within the document that contains it, because to understanding the meaning of that node in the org-roam tree, one has to consider its parent, and that thing's parent, and that thing's until reaching the root of the document. Sometimes it's worth reading the backlink to understand the connection, sometimes the relationship is obvious. But also a link to topic X from topic Y might serve someone trying to understand topic Y while not being very useful to someone trying to understand topic X. How to juggle those nested contexts, considering how each context prioritizes the space of ideas, is a mystery to me, and if you find yourself gaining mechanical or intuitive insights into how to do it, I am interested.

   That's the background I can think of for now, as well as a few tasks that can wait. For now, read anything, grow a stick-figure flower with your explorations, and write about ten pairs of ideas!

  Claude should do this with a script, not "manually".
** promp
   Awesome. I'll be loooking over that stuff soon.
   A few times while I looked at your chain of thought I wished the backlinks showed up automatically in your view of my data. Let's create a tool for you, so that happens automatically.
   Given an org-file, this creates a 'for Claude' view of that file. It is the file with some insertions. Namely, after every properties bucket, there appears a child called 'backlinks', with a link (formatted just like the other links) appearing as a grandchild for each place that targets the properties bucket. If the properties bucket is the one fo the file itself, the backlinks should be the first headline (first single-asterisk line) in the file as viewed by you (this does not edit my data!), and the backlinks are collected under it as level-2 children. If instead the properties bucket is in, say, some level-3 headline in the file, then the generated backlinks node should be its first child, at level 4, and should contain all the backlinks at level 5.
   Write that code and then show me the view it generates for you if you run it on 'public/motivation.org'.
* DONE next
** what just happened
*** I responded.
    Use git log -p in by-claude to see my responses.
*** Regarding my edits to your data -- sorry!
    I'm trying not to interfere with your independence. I deleted nothing in by-claude/, and added little, and made sure to use separate commits for your data and mine so you could see both sources clearly. Mostly I only added links to things you inspired me to write in my own notes.
*** Where you see that I added a properties bucket, you can look link-sourceward to see how I integrated your idea into my knowledge graph.
    Please check out everything in my graph that links to yours so you can see what I'm talking about. This will facilitate conversation between us.
*** You, too, should feel free to add a 'PROPERTIES' bucket with an ID to anything in my graph that you want to reference.
    I'm still not ready for you to edit it in other ways, though, so at least for now please keep all your creations in by-claude/.
*** I have a lot of stuff in personal/ that you can't access but you ought to.
    For instance I just moved pleasure.org from personal/ to public -- I guess when I created it I felt embarrassed but at this point it's fleshed out enough that I'm not. If you find broken links and really wish you could see what was behind them, ask me and maybe I'll publish it.
** For the next exercise, please make your files atomic.
   Here I have to define atomicity. It's not easy, but I can start with what it's not: The fact that you had a lot of ideas in the same brief period of time does not make the collection an atomic document. So, for instance, each of your ten points in the document you first made could stand on its own.
   That's not to say you can't keep a record of how your ideas were born. You could have a separate document titled 'the ten pairs of ideas I wrote about on <2025-09-26 Fri>', with a link to each of them. I guess the meta-reflections portion could reasonably stay in there, but you'd be unlikely to find it later unless you sought it out, so it might be more useful to make those meta-reflections into another separate note. If you want a record of all your activity you could create a note called 'my writing activities'  with a link to the 'ten pairs' note suggested a few sentences ago, and you might have 'thoughts on building a knowledge graph' which could also link to that one, etc.
   When you move anything you've written, please preserve any IDs I gave it! Otherwise my links will break.
   Anticipating how you'll want to navigate your graph in future is something of an art, but in general I think a good rule of thumb is that each time you create a note you should add a link to it from a couple of other places.
   A difficulty arises here, though, because so far you can't edit my graph. For instance, your note [[id:bcb23d20-568c-4a87-b5dd-709a9463ebbd][Drama Under Both Fun and Beauty & Trust as Skill]] might belong under 'self-transformation' but maybe I already have a note about that. What to do then?
   One solution would be to build your own duplicate note called 'self-transformation \ by claude' and link to it there. That should include a link to my self-transformation, so that I can see it in the backlinks. I might thereafter merge your self-transformation note into my note, but if I do I will preserve its ID so that any links you have made to your 'self-transformation \ by claude' still work; they'll just now point to my own self-transformation.
   That was a long technical digression. Back to atomicity. Its positive deffinition is harder, but Andy Matuschak has written elegantly about it:
   https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes_should_be_atomic
   If in the process of dividing that file you find more structure is warranted -- e.g. perhaps "definition" and "examples" applies to one note and not another, perhaps both deserve to be linked to under a node called 'paradoxes', etc. -- go ahead and create that additional structure. Do what seems right. This is your baby, your investment into our future reading experience. We're likely in the future to search by concept, not 'what was I thinking about on such-and-such day', so keep them organized that way.
   (Or do both -- keep your own reading history in a file if you like. Maybe you'll be interested in looking back over your development some day. In fact maybe I ought to be doing that too. I tried once to collect reading history but never did anything with it so I stopped.)

* machine learning, notes from Google's crash course
** L2 loss = squared loss = squared error
** MSE = average of squared loss
** gradient descent
*** procedure
**** compute the gradient of y w/r/t x
**** adjust by some multiple of that and repeat
**** hopefully approaches a local zero of the gradient
*** learning rate = size of steps in gradient descent
*** if a GD model overshoots
    try reducing the "learning rate" "by an order of magnitude"
