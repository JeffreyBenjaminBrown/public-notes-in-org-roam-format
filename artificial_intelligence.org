* TODO What happens if you ask it to report confidence intervals* with every answer?
  (*) even informal ones, like "I'm not sure, I suspect, I believe ..." could be interesting -- maybe making the advice more useful if they are accurate, maybe triggering an interesting self-reflection in the AI.

* machine learning, notes from Google's crash course
** L2 loss = squared loss = squared error
** MSE = average of squared loss
** gradient descent
*** procedure
**** compute the gradient of y w/r/t x
**** adjust by some multiple of that and repeat
**** hopefully approaches a local zero of the gradient
*** learning rate = size of steps in gradient descent
*** if a GD model overshoots
    try reducing the "learning rate" "by an order of magnitude"
