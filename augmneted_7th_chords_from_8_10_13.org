#+title: harmonic augmneted 7th chords based on 8:10:13
The central triad in all three chords is 8:10:13,
but each uses a different 7th degree,
to come as close as possible to the familiar aug7
(without straying into high harmonics).

Some of the intervals are listed below in terms of cents.

8Â  : 10 : 13 : 14 ~ aug 7
10 : 13 : 16 : 18 ~ aug 7
13 : 16 : 20 : 24 ~ aug neutral 7

The thirds:
10 :  8 ~ 386 cents
13 : 10 ~ 454 cents
16 : 13 ~ 359 cents

The sevenths (as reduced fractions):
7  : 4  ~ 969 cents
9  : 5  ~ 1018 cents
24 : 13 ~ 1061 cents
