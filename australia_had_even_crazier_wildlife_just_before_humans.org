#+title: Australia had even crazier wildlife just before humans.
* "Before Sapiens, there were giant birds, lizards that looked like dragons, and kangaroos and wombats that weighed more than 2 tons. Within a few thousand years [after humans arrived], 23/24 Australian animals that weight 50kg or more were extinct."
* Theories of how it happened.
** hunting
** Intentional burning of forests.
   "Maybe humans transformed the environment using fire agriculture. It was common to burn forests to create grasslandsâ€“ much better for hunting. Eucalyptus trees are robust to fire. These were rare before Sapiens came, but common after."
** The concurrent climate change may have mattered.
   Note that the ocean life around Australia seems to have been unaffected by that climate change.
