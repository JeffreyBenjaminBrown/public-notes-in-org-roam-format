* A functional explanation of awe.

   It draws attention away from the self
   and toward a complex reality
     that it helps to understand.

** the quote

*** it
    A more recent study found that experiencing awe increased perceptions of time and led to a greater willingness to donate time, but not to donate money.[20] The greater willingness to donate time appeared to be driven by decreased impatience after experiencing awe. Experiencing awe also led participants to report greater momentary life satisfaction and stronger preferences for experiential versus material goods (e.g. prefer a massage to a watch).[20] Awe, unlike most other positive emotions, has been shown to increase systematic processing, rather than heuristic processing, leading participants who experience awe to become less susceptible to weak arguments.[14]

* awe and oceanity v. cognitive closure and concreteness
  Wikipedia on awe, <2025-10-21 Tue>:
  """ ... found that people who regularly experience awe ("awe-prone") have a lower need for cognitive closure and are more likely to describe themselves in oceanic (e.g. "I am an inhabitant of the planet Earth"), individuated, and universal terms, as opposed to more specific terms (e.g. "I have blonde hair")."""
