#+title: AWS Route53
* how to associate a domain name with an EC2 instance
  It's easy.
** a ref
   https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-to-ec2-instance.html
** PITFALL: The domain name I bought for the Observatorio is for Ohio
   not N Virginia like the rest of what I do.
*** TODO can I make it available in both?
** PITFALL: They appear not to be copiable.
** alternatives
   Editing an old one is *very slightly* faster than creating a new one.
*** create a new association in Route53
    Go to that domain in Route53.
    Choose Create Record.
    The first three boxes are all I used, and I think I left at least one of them the way it was.
*** edit an old association ("record") in Route53
    serial
**** Go to the Hosted Zone.
**** Click the checkbox next to the relevant record.
**** Click Edit. PITFALL: It's in a weird sidebar.
**** Change the IPv4 address.
