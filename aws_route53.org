#+title: AWS Route53
* how to associate a domain name with an EC2 instance
  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-to-ec2-instance.html
** TODO PITFALL: The domain name I bought for the Observatorio is for Ohio
   not N Virginia like the rest of what I do.
*** TODO can I make it available in both?
** faster: edit an old association in Route53
   I've already got something associated with sim.jefbrown.net.
   Just tweak that to the new IPv4 address.
** how to create the association in Route53
   Go to that domain in Route53.
   Choose Create Record.
   The first three boxes are all I used, and I think I left at least one of them the way it was.
