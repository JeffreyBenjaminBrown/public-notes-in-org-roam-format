* rec's at least 48 hours
* "electrolytes + sea salt"
* multivitamin
* refeed gradually
  eat a bit, wait; repeat
* green tea or hudia gardenia
  better if "naturally decaffeinated"
  source of antioxidants
  hudia suppresses appetite
* edta : a chelator
  good for removing excess iron, and (less so?) calcium
  but it removes other minerals,
  so take the multivitamin and electrolytes 12 hours later
  only take the edta twice a week, to avoid pulling out too many minerals
