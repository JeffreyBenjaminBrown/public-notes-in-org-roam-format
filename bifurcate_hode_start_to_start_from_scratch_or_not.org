#+title: bifurcate hode-start to start from scratch or not
**** BLOCKED because this is only really needed if I solve the  [[id:2e092160-cb83-4bce-8ffb-cc2264270c0b][persistent Docker data insanity]] problem
     which I might not need to do
* write a `hode-start` with a program argument
  For stuff do run after starting the container,
  before starting TypeDB.
* `hode-start-fresh` = (hode-start nil)
* `hode-restart` = (hode-start (load saved data on host))
* `hode-write-db-to-host`
* DONE test [[id:ed824eee-35cd-4310-9a1c-311ef1f0dc7e][higher-order functions in Emacs Lisp]]
