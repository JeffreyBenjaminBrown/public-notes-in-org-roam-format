#+title: blocks content for reader (relationship)
* [content] blocks [content] (in [context])
** semi-ternary, like [[id:33d5cd4e-8a0c-48f0-85c2-467db86e1862][shows-because]]
* Requires reader cooperation!
* ? herald 'first'
* parse org-mode pre-indentation as this
** [[id:93eeb370-9f9c-4375-957d-91aab39007ee][Parsing it is simpler than one might expect.]]
** two org passages that parse equivalently
*** Punchline: Some information can be discarded.

** how
   How they should parse: The body is the first child. The child headline after it is the second child. Only its title blocks reading the list of children; the rest of it can be folded, and it can have tree content (unlike the org-body). So on for each of the others. If the level of pre-indentation changes, there is no change in its treatment.
