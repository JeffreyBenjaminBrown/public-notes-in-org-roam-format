#+title: blurb about me, for pitching Shyg to the Mercatus Center
I am a programmer, data scientist and economist. I have worked at the US Congressional Budget Office, in health economics consulting, as director of technology and chief software architect at a small university think tank, and for the Colombian government, most recently as an advisor to Colombia's Minister of Commerce.

I have used knowledge mapping software enthusiastically for more than twenty years, swapping apps each time I found a better one. Within perhaps only weeks of starting, knowledge mapping had become an integral part of my thought process. I am the second contributor (of only two) to work on the Semantic Synchrony knowledge graph project.

As a PhD student (in economics at MSU) I was part of a study group that would share notes and work through problems at the end of each day. The power of sharing and collectively working through ideas among even a small number of people (most days we were between 3 and 7) was a revelation to me that I still marvel at. It is part of the reason I believe a shared knowledge graph could be immensely powerful even at a very small scale.
