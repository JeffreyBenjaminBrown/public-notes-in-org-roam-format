#+title: Breath is a special focus, because it is semi-voluntary.
You can consciously control your breath,
but most of the time you don't.
Meditating on it is a microcosm of meditating on the self,
the actor as a whole -- learning to observe your doing,
without (in some sense) doing it, or at least not forcing it.
