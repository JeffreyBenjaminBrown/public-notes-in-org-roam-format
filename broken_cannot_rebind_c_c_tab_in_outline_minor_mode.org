#+title: BROKEN: Cannot rebind `C-c @ TAB` in outline-minor-mode
Emacs won't let me bind `C-c @ TAB` to `outline-cycle` in `outline-minor-mode`. It complains "Lisp error: (error "Key sequence C-c @ TAB starts with non-prefix key C-c @") -- but `C-c @` is bound to nothing.

Some minimal code to reproduce this experience would be the following:
```
(outline-minor-mode)
(setq-local outline-regexp "-- [*]+")
(setq outline-minor-mode-cycle t)
```

At this point, by running `C-h k C-c @` you can verify that `C-c @` is bound to nothing. Moreover, if you go on to press `TAB`, you can see that `C-c @ TAB` *is* bound to something. So it's a perfectly good key sequence.

Now try to redefine what it is bound to:
```
(define-key org-mode-map (kbd "C-c @ TAB") 'outline-cycle)
```

and, if your system behaves like mine, you'll get the error.
