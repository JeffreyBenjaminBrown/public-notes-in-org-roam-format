#+title: brushing teeth and coffee in morning
* Solution: Brush immediately on waking
  Since I wait an hour before drinking coffee,
  this alone solves the problem.
* Half-measur: rinse a lot
  Rinse mouth with water
    before and after coffee, and
    after brushing.
* Bad: Coffee right after brushing.
  The acid can damage the teeth more easily, because
    1 - no protective saliva buffer
    2 - the toothpaste raises the pH of the teeth
* Worst: Brush right after coffee.
  The coffee softens the enamel.
