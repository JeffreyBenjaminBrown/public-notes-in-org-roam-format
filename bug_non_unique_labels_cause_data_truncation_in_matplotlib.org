#+title: BUG: Non-unique labels cause data truncation in matplotlib.
This might arise in other contexts.
At the least, when drawing bar charts,
a label set (for the x-axis) like ["a","b","c","a","b","c"]
will cause the bar chart to have only three bars, not six,
even if every other input vector is likewise length six.
