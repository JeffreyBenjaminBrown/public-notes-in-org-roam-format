#+title: bug: Oculus Quest 2 stuck showing a white ring
* advice that worked
** hold power and volume buttons at the same time to reboot
   I guess that's a different kind of reboot than the one where you just power down with the power button.
* advice that failed
** Someone says turn it off and charge it.
   That was on some forum.
** Someone says it goes away on its own, just let it run for a long time.
