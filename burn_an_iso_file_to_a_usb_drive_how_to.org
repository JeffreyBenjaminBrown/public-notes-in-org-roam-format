#+title: burn an .iso file to a USB drive, how to
serial
* Use lsblk to determine which drive it is.
* Make sure it's not mounted.
* Be sure not to write to a partition (e.g. sdb1).
  Rather, write to the drive completely (sdb).
* Write it.
  sudo dd if=/path/to/the.iso of=/dev/sdxxx bs=1M
** PITFALL: `sdxxx` doesn't exist. That's intentional.
   Change `sdxxx` to something sensible like `sda`.
