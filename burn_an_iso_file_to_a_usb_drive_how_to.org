#+title: burn an .iso file to a USB drive, how to
* how
  Use lsblk to determine which drive it is.
  Make sure it's not mounted.
  Don't write to a partition (e.g. sdb1);
    rather, write to the drive completely (sdb).
  Then:
    # PITFALL: This won't work, because sdxxx does not exist.
    # Put something sensible there (see above).
    sudo dd if=/path/to/the.iso of=/dev/sdxxx bs=1M
  Example:
    sudo dd \
      if=/home/jeff/excluded-from-borg/xubuntu-24.04-desktop-amd64.iso \
      of=/dev/sda \
      bs=1M
