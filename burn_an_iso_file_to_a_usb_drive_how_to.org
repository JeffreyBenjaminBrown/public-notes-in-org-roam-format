#+title: burn an .iso file to a USB drive, how to
* how
  Use lsblk to determine which drive it is.
  Make sure it's not mounted.
  Don't write to a partition (e.g. sdb1);
    rather, write to the drive completely (sdb).
  Then:
    # PITFALL: This won't work, because sdxxx does not exist.
    # Put something sensible there (see above).
    sudo dd if=/path/to/the.iso of=/dev/sdxxx bs=1M
  Example:
    sudo dd \
      if=/home/jeff/linux-distros/nixos-plasma5-21.11.334027.e34c5379866-x86_64-linux.iso \
      of=/dev/sdb \
      bs=1M
