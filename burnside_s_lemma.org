#+title: Burnside's lemma: Count distinct colorings modulo symmetries
* Its purpose
  is to count the number of distinct orbits of a set of colorings of a space subject to a set of symmetries -- for instance, the number of distinct ways of coloring a cube.
* PITFALL: the set of colorings does not have to be all possible colorings.
  For instance, this can be used to count triads in 12-edo.
  To do so, you consider the set of 2-colorings for which
  3 spots are colored 1 and the rest 0.
* the theorem
  Given a set C of colorings:
    |orbits| = (1 / |symmetries|) *
               sum over each symmetry g of |colorings in C fixed by g|
