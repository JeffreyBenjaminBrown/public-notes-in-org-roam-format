#+title: Calming music helps me prepare to sleep.
* at least relative to continuing hype music
  When I should go to bed and am pumped up on some idea, and want to keep going, calming music works! And the weird thing is I don't want to put it on in those situations. Or, I do intellectually but not emotionally.
* I'm not sure it would help in all circumstances.
  If I had just meditated, for instance,
  it might inject more energy, counterproductively.
