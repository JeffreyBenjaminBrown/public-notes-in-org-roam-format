#+title: Can't Fight, by Liane la Havas
* key
  original: E^
* song
  [verse:]
  [0, 3]
  It seems that I won't be warned.
  And certainly I saw a sign.
  I raged like a woman scorned,
  but something about you got me goin'.
  You're pulling me back and I'm going under.

  [chorus:]
  [5, 4\0, 2, 7]
  A little peace, a little love,
  a little bit, is that enough?
  I can't fight away this love.
  I knew that I should give you up.
  I tried to run but got my heart stuck.
  I can't fight away this love.

  [verse 2]
  The things that I want and need
  they always seem to be at odds with me.
  Why?
  When did heaven gt this heavy?
  Everything's right until it's wrong.
  But something about you feels like home.
  Baby you know that you got me goin'
  You're pulling me back and I'm going under.

  [chorus ...]
