#+title: cast-iron pans, how to use
* Warm pan slowly.
* Warm pan from empty (not even oil).
** heating with oil can damage the oil
* Use the least temperature that works, which is surprisingly low.
* Will not need coating, as long as the enamel does not chip.
* Avoid chipping: Don't tap with metal things, even spoons.
* Don't make it suddenly cold, i.e. by submerging in water when hot.
* Dry with a towel; don't leave it wet.
* Scrape with plastic or wood, never steel (even steel wool).
