#+title: Cats are less diverse than dogs, because they are "perfect".
https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/cats-are-perfect-an-evolutionary-biologist-explains-why/

Disappointing article -- does not explain why they are perfect,
only that they dominate their particular hypercarnivorous evolutionary niche,
to the exclusion of some other species that sometimes "try".
Claims that monitor lizards are similar.
Both kinds of animal look very similar at widely varying scales.
Other kinds of animals -- esp. bats, mice, bears --
that are much more diverse are diverse "because they suck",
that is, they have not dominated any particular niche.
