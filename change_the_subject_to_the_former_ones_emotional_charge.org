#+title: If someone gets mad, etc. for reasons that appear unfounded, change the subject to that.
* example conversation
  "I feel [afraid of x]"."
  "[Gets mad]".
  "Why are you mad? I'm just saying how I feel."
* the idea
  Often my tendency is to simply make a note of how they feel,
  but continue on-topic.
  But how they feel has become more important.
