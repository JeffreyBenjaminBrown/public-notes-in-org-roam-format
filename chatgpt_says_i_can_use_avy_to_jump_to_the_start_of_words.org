#+title: ChatGPT says I can use 'avy' to jump to the start of words.
If you're comfortable using packages, avy is a powerful navigation tool that can jump to any visible word or character on the screen.

Use avy-goto-word-1 to jump to the beginning of a word by typing:

    (global-set-key (kbd "C-c j") 'avy-goto-word-1)

With avy, you can quickly jump to the start of a word and avoid the need for typical search behavior.
