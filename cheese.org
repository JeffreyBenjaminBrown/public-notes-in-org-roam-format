#+title: cheese (videoconference softwrae)
* PITFALL! I use a different NixOS config to use it
For my regular, non-pulseaudio build, these lines are commented out.
** to build NixOS this way
*** the hopefully easiest way
apply the first diff in the branch called
  cheese-record-camera-and-mic
*** if that fails, do this
**** packages.nix: I added these lines
    # For feeding the mic into Cheese (for webcam videos)
    # PITFALL: This borks a lot of my audio.
    # There's an alsa emulator for pulse wchich might work better.
    pavucontrol # Pulse Audio Volume Control, needed for audio in Cheese
	# according to this kid: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0B0-SilJw4
    pulseaudio # I'm just guessing I need this; nobody said so
**** audio.nix: I added these lines
    # For feeding the mic into Cheese (for webcam videos)
    # Was suggested here: https://nixos.wiki/wiki/PulseAudio
    # PITFALL: This borks much of my audio setup.
    hardware.pulseaudio.enable = true;
* use lsof to check what processes (esp. pulseaudio, alsamixer) are using sound devices
sudo lsof /dev/snd/*

** Kid says pulse audio volume control (pavucontrol) needed
to connect mic to Cheese
