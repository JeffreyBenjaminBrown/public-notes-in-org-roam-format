* notes
  The Pendleton Act (1883) "at first ... covered very few jobs but there was a ratchet provision whereby outgoing presidents could lock in their own appointees by converting their jobs to civil service".
  "After a series of party reversals at the presidential level (in 1884, 1888, 1892, 1896) ... most federal jobs were under civil service."
  "An unintended result was the shift of the parties to reliance on funding from business, since they could no longer depend on patronage hopefuls"
