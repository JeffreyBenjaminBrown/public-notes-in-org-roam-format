#+title: Cliff on trading options <2025-10-25 Sat>
* options w/ Cliff
  "enter an order to sell an option" on something I have.
  It is created when the transaction closes.
  Easier to get those approved than naked options,
  which are not owned. (Not cheaper.)
  To do anything with options, need approval.
* selling options on something you own seems smart
  earn another 3-4% by selling a covered option every 6 months
* Shorts are dangerous. Puts are better.
* Has to be done to at least 100 shares.
