** constructors for immutable data
   Since data types are immutable, __init__ construction wonâ€™t work. Instead, a different special method __new__ is used
** function composition pipe operators ..>, <.., ..*>, and <*...
** Lazy lists can refer to as-yet unbound variables.
   abcd = (| d(a), d(b), d(c) |)  # a, b, c, and d are not defined yet
   def d(n) = n + 1

   a = 1
   abcd$[0]
   b = 2
   abcd$[1]
** Use __truediv__ to define the / operator, which can then be used as a one character  op.
** Fmap is like map plus a constructor. If I map a class and get back a tuple, use fmap instead.
