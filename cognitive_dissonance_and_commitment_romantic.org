#+title: cognitive dissonance and commitment (romantic)
* seems fine, to an extent
  I can see a certain amount of willful cognitive dissonance being healthy. In the time between leaving one's family and getting married -- the most formative years of a person's personality -- one becomes accustomed to making all of one's decisions without any need for compromise. Then it stops being that way. We get married because we think we're better off married, and we're usually right, but it doesn't mean we're better off in every way.

  And having kids raises the bar for divorce pretty high. I imagine the cognitive dissonance that parents are willing to put up with crushes anything I've experienced.
