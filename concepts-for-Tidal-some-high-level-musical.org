#+title: concepts for Tidal, some high-level musical
* TODO mysteries
** interpreting a melody as samples
   It's not clear that this should even be done.
** interpreting a melody as other parameters
** beat usage
** transformations
** avoiding collistions
** restricting the pitch set over some intervals
* pitch set
** definition
   It is an octave-repeating set of frequencies,
   represented as a pair (f,rs),
   where rs is a set of ratios in (1,2)
   and f is a frequency in hz.
* melody
** definition
   A melody is a piecewise constant map "m"
   from time to [the integers + the empty set {}].
   Where m t = {}, the melody is silent.
   The melody should *probably* be defined with a pitch set ps in mind,
   as two integers values in the range of m which are equal mod (len ps)
   result in pitches that are equal modulo octave.
** usage
   One defines how a voice "lenses into" a melody "rs"
   via some base frequency "fv" in Hz.
   If "ri" = 0 is in "rs", the resulting pitch is f*2**n,
   where "n" is the integer such that f*2**n is closest to "fv".
   If "ri" = len rs, the resulting pitch is f*2**(n+1).
   Etc.
* harmony
** Nudge the continuous frequency measure to align its important notes once quantized.
** Some voices can use more out notes than others.
   For instance, perhaps on the downbeat the bass should always be in-chord while the melody need not even be in-scale.
** Distinguish chord from within scale.
*** TODO How to use the distinction?
*** how to represent the distinction
    alternatives
**** Give a list of scale indices.
**** Provide two lists.
     one of chord notes and one of out-of-chord scale notes.
** ? multidimensional scale indices
*** At least one dimension for priority
    e.g. root, chord, scale and "out"
    but maybe finer or coarser
*** At least one dimension for, roughly, frequency.
* a bar = the biggest repeating unit of the meter
* tempo = what fixes the duration of a bar
* a meter = a coordinate system for time
** definition
*** first, define "homogeneous meter"
    A homogeneous meter is two lists of integers > 1.
    The first list [n1, n2 ...] should be interpreted as finite,
    and indicates that time in that meter
    is divided into n1 pieces, each of which is divided into n2 pieces, etc.
    The second list determines how the smallest pieces are divided,
    and should be interpreted as repeating.
    It describes the finest level of coordinates.
    In the simplest case it will be a simple number, probably usually [2].
    That indicates that all of the smallest subdivisions are binary.
    If it is instead [2,3], that indicates that the first subdivision
    after the finite sequence of divisions is binary,
    then there is a tertiary division, then 2 again, then 3 again,
    repeating forever.
*** next define "compound meter"
    A compound meter is a list of pairs (ti :: Real, hm :: Homog Meter),
    where the first ti is 0, each subsequent ti is greater than the previous,
    all are less than 1.
** usage
   A moment is specified with a list of integers.
   The first is unrestricted.
   The rest are constrained by the meter; they should range from 0 to n-1,
   where n is the number of divisions at the corresponding level.
** NUANCE: overflow
   If a moment is encoded with a value greater than
   M = the maximum allowed at that subdivision,
   it should probably decrement itself by M
   and increment its parent coordinate by 1.
   If this bumps the moment into the next homogenous meter
   in a compound meter, its interpretation changes,
   but the algorithm can continue.
* a beat = a priority list of moments
** definition
   A beat is a list of lists of moments.
   Earlier lists are higher priority (hence "prior").
   The moments in each list should be ordered,
   but no order needs to hold across moments in distinct lists.
