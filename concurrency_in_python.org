#+title: concurrency in Python
* the trick
  Subclass threading.Thread,
  define "run()" in the class definition,
  and then run its "start()" method (not, strangely, the "run()" method).
* example
  from time import sleep
  from threading import Thread

  class MyThread (Thread):
    def run(self):
      print("I'm the mythread, about to sleep.")
      sleep(2)
      print("I'm the mythread, just woke up. Now I die.")

  def go():
    mt = MyThread()
    print("I'm the go().")
    mt.start()
    print("go() quitting now.")
    return 1

  x = go()
