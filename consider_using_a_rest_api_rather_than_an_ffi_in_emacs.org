#+title: Consider using a REST API rather than an FFI in Emacs.
External (non-emacs; probably Rust) server runs a small web server (using something like actix-web, rocket, or warp).
Emacs uses its built-in HTTP functionality (url.el or request.el) to make calls.
Data is typically exchanged as JSON.
