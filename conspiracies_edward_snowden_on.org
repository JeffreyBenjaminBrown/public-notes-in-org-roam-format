* Conspiracy theories absolve believers of the obligation to engage with the truth.
* conspiracy theory <=> powerlessness
  "conspiracy theories do not inculcate powerlessness, so much as they are the signs and symptoms of powerlessness itself."
* motivations for believing conpsiracy theories
** [#A] existential: to feel safe, e.g. taken care of
** epistemic: just to know
** social
* "conspiracies themselves are a taxonomy"
  "[C]onspiracies themselves are a taxonomy, a method by which democracies especially sort themselves into parties and tribes, a typology through which people who lack definite or satisfactory narratives as citizens explain to themselves their immiseration, their disenfranchisement, their lack of power, and even their lack of will."
