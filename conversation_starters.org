* some principles
** [[id:2a435ecf-ddb5-4822-b52f-0667a02ac52c][Doorknobs -- good conversation has lots of.]]
** open-ended questions
   rather than ones with yes/no answers
** share first
** become more intimate, slowly
   e.g. start with mundane stuff, like vacation plans
** show appreciation
* some conversation starters
** ask them (implicitly) to analyze
*** What'ssomething you love to do?
*** What’s a goal you’re pursuing right now?
*** What’s a challenge you’re facing?
*** What’s the best change you’ve made
    during the pandemic?
    since getting married?
    since having kids?
** ask them to elaborate
*** Ask about someone's life stories, decisions
**** Normally they talk about the recent.
*** Tell me about your hometown.
*** Say more about your day.
*** Explain your work to me.
** (in response to a raised eyebrow): Tell me about that look.
