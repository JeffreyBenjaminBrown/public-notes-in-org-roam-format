#+title: Coordinating with a bass, solo or otherwise, should not be too hard.
It's just one note to follow.
* implications for solo recording
  First, play drums in one hand and bass in the other.
  Overdub on to that,
  and I've only got one note to look at at a time on the screen.
* implication for playing in a group : Find a bassist!
