#+title: Coverage (Bioinformatics)
* definition
** For a particular position in the geneome,
coverage is the number of reads we have that include it.
** For the genome as a whole,
coverage is just its average over all positions.
Unknowable without knowing total genome length.
* PITFALL: The reads "covering" that position might not agree on what's there.
