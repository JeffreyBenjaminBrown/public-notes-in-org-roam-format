#+title: Crocel kit for drumgizmo
* refs
** I'm keeping kits (including the layouts I make for them) here
   ~/excluded-from-borg/drums/
* layouts
I was keeping them here as text depictions,
but that was dumb, because I need a single source of truth.
So to see what one is like, just load it and try it out.
It should have a comment on the intended orientation of the Zendrum,
if it's one of the three unusual-looking ones.
* notes on the drums
  intended for laying them out better
** the choked crashes are fixed-duration
** in freq, CrX < CrL < CrR

** the toms all feel pretty similar
** the hats
*** HP cuts off the others.
*** in duration, HC < HS < HO
*** HS and HCNP are pretty similar.
*** HPH is a nice ringing opening with little attack.
** the snares
*** SRest is part of a roll.
*** SRimS is very quiet.
*** SRim pops.
** in freq, ChL > ChR, and they're very different
   ChR is big and grandiose.
   ChL is like "that's all folks".
** in freq, SpL < SpR, but they're pretty similar
** I really like the ride bell.
** the two kicks are equivalent
   so just keep them far apart
