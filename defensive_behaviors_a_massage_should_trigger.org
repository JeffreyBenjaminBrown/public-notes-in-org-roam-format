#+title: defensive behaviors that receiving a massage should trigger
* see also [[id:2b49db8e-8279-42ae-a23c-e3ca35addc39][Salespeople suck. They *have to* suck.]]
* refuse these things
  Refuse hand, foot massage.
  More generally, anywhere there's not much muscle --
  e.g. back of the knee.
* If communication is impossible, refuse all of it.
  The only time I tried that I regretted it.
  And it could have been far worse.
  It's too dangerous, not worth it.
