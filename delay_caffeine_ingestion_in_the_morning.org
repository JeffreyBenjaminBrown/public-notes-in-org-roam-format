#+title: Delay caffeine ingestion in the morning.
* what to do
  Wait an hour or two after waking up before ingesting caffeine.
* why
  It allows cortisol to clear away whatever adenosine is left
  that sleep did not clear up. (Sleep clears 90% of it.)
  Caffeine and cortisol bind to the same receptor,
  so caffeine blocks it from doing that.
  Cortisol is naturally high upon waking up.
* my experience : It works.
