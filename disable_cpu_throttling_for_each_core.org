#+title: disable CPU throttling for each core
* how to do it
** This is shorter and probably works too
   sudo cpufreq-set -r -g performance
** I know this works
   serial
*** run a throwaway sudo
    # First evaluate this,
    # as a separate block of input text,
    # so that my password is not clobbered
    # by the subsequent commands.
    sudo ls
*** do it
    # as described in Pianoteq Linux README
    sudo cpufreq-set -c 0 -g performance
    sudo cpufreq-set -c 1 -g performance
    sudo cpufreq-set -c 2 -g performance
    sudo cpufreq-set -c 3 -g performance
* how to undo it
  Do like above, but substitute `powersave` for `performance`.
  There are other options too:
