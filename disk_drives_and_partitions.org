  ExFAT looks best.
** FAT32: "ms dos" format
*** PITFALL: Seems not to let me change permissions.
*** good for files up to 4GB
*** Supposedly maximum compatibility --

    but I had a thumbdrive that was slow with this,
    and when I reformatted it for NTFS, it was fast.
** NTFS: "linux" format?
   Good for files up to (16 EiB – 1 KB) (insanely huge).
   Works on Windows and on most Linux distributions.
   Works on Mac but read-only.
** ExFAT: ???
   Good for files up to (16 EiB – 1 KB) (insanely huge).
   Works on Windows or Mac
   Works on Linux but requires extra drivers.
* show all disks
** `lsblk`         : concise
** `sudo fdisk -l` : verbose
* how to [[id:7a132233-bf78-4b3a-b191-0d79915612c7][burn an .iso file to a USB drive]]

  serial
** The disk should not be mounted.
** Find details of all disks, mounted and unmounted.
   sudo fdisk -l
** define sdxnjjj = the folder correspoonding to the drive,
   where x is probably b, c or d,
         n is probably a small digit or maybe missing
         jj should not be there (this prevents copy-paste disaster)
** choose options for the base command
   So far I like
*** -f : fast, i.e. without writing a ton of zeroes
**** PITFALL: Available for NTFS and not ExFAT.
** base commands to choose from
   Choose based on [[id:8285b7f2-ce8d-4601-9f0a-5c95a11223e4][formats: compatibility, capacity, maybe speed]].
   sudo mkfs.ext4  /dev/sdxnjjj  # ExFAT is the default for Linux.
     # It doesn't seem to accept the -f option.
   sudo mkfs.vfat  /dev/sdxnjjj # FAT32
   sudo mkfs.ntfs  /dev/sdxnjjj # NTFS
   sudo mkfs.exfat /dev/sdxnjjj # ExFAT
** give it ordinary user permissions
   mount it, go to its parent folder, and run:
   sudo chown -R jeff:users <disk_name>
* delete a partition with fdisk
  serial
** The disk should not be mounted.
** `sudo fdisk /dev/sdxxx` (where xxx is probably b, c or d)
** `d` : delete
** `p` : show hypothetical resulting `p`artitions
   to verify the delete)
** `w` : write changes and exit
* create a partition with fdisk
  serial
** The disk should not be mounted.
** `sudo fdisk /dev/sdxxx` (where xxx is probably b, c or d)
** `n` : new partition
** follow the prompts
** `w` : write changes and exit
** [[id:4953e1db-1fd6-4b62-b454-617de86117e5][format the new partition]]
* label a partition
  tag name rename label relabel
** [[id:982f48ba-9ed5-4c21-bcaf-a6b8c3571e85][gnome-disk-utility can do it in some cases.]]
** The way to do it depends on the format.
*** Labeling an ext4 partition with e2label is easy.
    e.g., this worked
      sudo e2label /dev/sdb _scribble_ssd_500g_samsung
      (I've scribbled over that name so as not to clobber
      the device later with a thoughtless copy-and-paste.)
*** Labeling a dos partition with mlabel might be tricky.
**** There's probably a better way,
     but I couldn't get parted to do the job;
     parted complained that the msdos format doesn't allow it.
**** PITFALL: Valid names are few.
     `mlabel` does not (yet) support lowercase letters,
     or names longer than 11 characters.
***** TODO Is this only a problem with the FAT32 format?
**** how
     With the disk not mounted, run
       sudo mlabel -i /dev/sdxnjj -s ::"LABEL HERE"
     where sdxnjjj = the folder correspoonding to the drive,
       where x is probably b, c or d
             n is probably a small digit or maybe missing
             jj should not be there (this prevents copy-paste disaster)
