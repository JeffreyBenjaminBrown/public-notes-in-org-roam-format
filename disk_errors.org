#+title: disk errors, how to check for

* some diagnostics
** sudo smartctl -H /dev/sdb
** sudo fsck /dev/sdb
   Or should it be
     sudo fsck /dev/sdb1
   ? That is, should it be the device itself (sdb),
   or a partition on it (sdb1)?
   On a good disk I was able to do both;
   on a bad disk, only the partition.
** sudo badblocks -svn -b 512 -c 65536 /dev/sdb
   The -b and -c options make it faster.
