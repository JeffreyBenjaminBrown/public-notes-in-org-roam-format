* Tutorial: Writing your first Django app
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/
** PITFALL: my filetree does't quite match the tutorial's
 (I *think* this is right.)
 They suggest a "mysite" folder,
 and next to it, the "polls" (app) folder.
 I'm doing that, but "mysite" is called "ebdjango".
** part 1
*** PITFALL: Django is for building a site, not serving it
  The "Django development server" is useful for  testing,
  but they suggest using something like Apache in production.
*** filetree and URL structure
**** Apps can be in multiple projects,
and a project can contain multiple apps.
***** apps "can live anywhere on your Python path"

      :END:
about the Python path:
  https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#tut-searchpath)
**** A Django project is a folder that includes
***** the following top-level files or folders:
  db.sqlite3
  <site-name>/ # without the <> marks
  manage.py
***** maybe a folder for each app located in the project
  Initially there are no such folders.
  There never need to be, because [[id:32559301-8128-44b0-a309-ca33c8909f31][apps can live anywhere on your Python path]]
**** <project-root>/<site-name>/ needs to "know" about an app,
  as described in [[id:ad943b01-c966-44f1-b5c9-74ef6eafb0f2][connect the view to the website]].
  Once it does, the app becomes available as a top-level
  subdomain of the project.
**** Each app corresponds to a top-level subdomain of the project URL.
  For instance, when I host my django project from
  localhost:8000, since 'polls' is an app in it, the URL
  localhost:8000/polls/ takes me to that app.
  (The trailing / is optional, but I believe preferred.)
*** create a new project
  django-admin startproject <desired name of new project>
**** PITFALL: avoid certain module names
   e.g. "django" or "test"
*** run the devel server
**** PITFALL: The devl server *usually* doesn't need restarting
   but certain changes, like adding a file,
   require a manual restart
**** how to run it
***** From inside a Docker container, do this:
     python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
****** That broadcasts to the 8000 port on all addresses,
   at least if the container was started (`docker run`) with the options
       -p 8000:8000 -d -h 127.0.0.1
***** From the host system (not using Docker) this is sufficient:
     python manage.py runserver
*** create a new app
**** How: from the folder containing manage.py, run
  python manage.py startapp <chosen app name>
**** What that does
  is create a new folder there, with that name,
  populating it with some Django boilerplate
  that can then be customized.
*** create a view
  Add some code to the app's views.py file.
  Example: my file `python-web-app/polls/views.py`
**** the laborious way
  from django.http import HttpResponse

  def index(request):
      return HttpResponse("Hello, world. You're at the polls index.")
**** easier: subclass any of Django's *View classes
  (Described in a later section of the tutorial.)
  Example: see the `index()` function for my "polls" app
*** connect the view to the website
    :PROPERTIES:
    :ID:       ad943b01-c966-44f1-b5c9-74ef6eafb0f2
    :END:
**** the idea
  When Django receives a request for URL,
  it crawls
    <project-root>/<site-name>//urls.py
  and then (probably)
    <some app folder>/urls.py
  to figure out what to do.
***** a little more detail
   Given a path, Django first searhes <project-root>/<site-name>/urls.py
     for a matching prefix.
   If the second argument is an include() expression, as in
       path('polls/', include('polls.urls'))
   then Django will look in the indicated file.
   Eventually it should bottom out at an expression like
       path('', views.index, name='index'),
   at which point it visits the "name" function in the file that's the second arg.
**** sample code
  see the "index" viewpattern in `<project-root>/<app-name>//urls.py`,
  and the "polls" urlpattern in `<project-root>/<site-name>/urls.py`.
**** PITFALL: "Patterns don’t search GET and POST parameters, or the domain name."
   For example, in a request to https://www.example.com/myapp/, the URLconf will look for myapp/. In a request to https://www.example.com/myapp/?page=3, the URLconf will also look for myapp/.
  My guess: The stuff after the '?' becomes arguments to the function called by the function found after looking up the part before the '?'.
*** PITFALL: probably still need [[id:d7718be6-7488-4a0e-8592-61b0a69a98f8][to (install?) the app in the project]]
In this trivial case, the website actually already works.
But if I try to use the database,
it will complain that I haven't installed the app in anything.
*** visit the view
  e.g. visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/polls/
    or equivalently, http://localhost:8000/polls/
  ("polls" is one of my pages.)
** part 2
*** <project-root>/<site-name>/settings.py
 uses SQLite by default.
**** PITFALL: for production, switch to something heavier-duty
 like Postgresql
**** choose TIME_ZONE from this list
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones
**** contains (among other things) a list of installed Django apps
**** if any apps must use the database, run "migrate" to (make the db?)
 python manage.py migrate
*** mysite/app/models.py

**** modify mysite/settings.py
    INSTALLED_APPS = [

*** the "Django shell"
with
  python manage.py shell
It's a normal Python REPL, except
**** *LIES*: according to part 2 of the tutorial it's nearly an ordinary python REPL
 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/
"manage.py sets the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable,
which gives Django the Python import path to your mysite/settings.py file."
**** it loads 1031 libraries

**** shell commands like `ls` are available in it

*** populate and modify the database, using the Django shell
**** from polls.models import Choice, Question
***** PITFALL: Every appearance of the word "question" and "choice" below,
including in longer field names, was automatically generated
based on our class names Question and Choice.
**** Question.objects.all()
**** instantiate a Question
that is, make a member of the already-defined Question class

 from django.utils import timezone
 q = Question( question_text="What's new?",
               pub_date=timezone.now() )
 q.save() # write `q` to the database
**** modify a question
In [4]: Question.objects.all()[0]
Out[4]: <Question: What's up?>

In [5]: q = Question.objects.all()[0]

In [6]: q.question_text = "What's going down?"

In [9]: q.save()
**** filter objects
 Question.objects.filter( question_text__startswith='What')
 Question.objects.filter(id=1)
 from django.utils import timezone
 current_year = timezone.now().year
 Question.objects.get( pub_date__year = current_year )
   # PITFALL: __ here is used like it was (.)
 Question.objects.get(pk=1)
   # works regardless what the primary key is called
 q = Question.objects.get(pk=1)
**** execute a user-defined method
 q . was_published_recently()
**** sets of associated rows
***** PITFALL: The definition of the host object does not (necessarily? ever?) know about its contents from other tables.
 For instance, in the tutorial's example "polls" app,
 there are Question and Choice types.
 Every Choice includes a field that is a Question.
 Thus every Question has (potentially) multiple Choices associated with it,
 but the definition of the Question type refers nowhere to Choice.
***** given a row, view associated rows from another table
 q.choice_set.create(choice_text='The usual', votes=0)
 q.choice_set.create(choice_text='Conquering the world', votes=0)
 q.choice_set.create(choice_text='So much winning', votes=0)
***** fold such a set
 q.choice_set.count()
**** "field lookups"
 lots of automatically created names
 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/db/queries/#field-lookups-intro
***** example
 Choice.objects.filter( question__pub_date__year = current_year)
***** double underscores are like dot in these names
***** class names are used to generate fields in other classes
**** delete a set of foreign keys
This deletes not every choice, but every choice associated with q:

 c = q . choice_set . filter( choice_text__startswith = 'Conquering')
 c . delete()
*** to use the website to restructure the database
**** create a superuser (offline)
 python manage.py createsuperuser
**** make an app admin-modifiable (offline)
 use django.contrib.admin.site.register
 see sample code at polls/admin.py
**** visit admin site
 127.0.0.1:8000/admin
** part 3
*** Many (most?) of my notes for this section are in the code
Specifically in
  polls/urls.py
  polls/views.py
  polls/templates/polls/*.html
*** the term URLCONF
  ROOT_URLCONF is defined in settings.py -- e.g.
    ROOT_URLCONF = 'ebdjango.urls'
  Each urls.py file is another URLCONF.
  They can refer to each other in a tree shape.
    (I assume cycles aren't allowed.)
*** how Django matches a `urlpattern`
  It starts at <project-name>.urls.urlpatterns(),
  where it looks up the first part of the URL.
  That will probably lead it to a function in another urls.py file,
  e.g. <app-name>.urls.urlpatterns(), which might lead to yet another.
  Eventually it bottoms out at a view -- e.g. see polls.urls.urlpatterns.
*** TODO How do capture patterns like <int:pk> work when the view the urls lead to is not a function but a View object?
**** I've answered the question in a special case
  Namely, in the special case of the code in the polls/ project.

  There, the "pk" variable clearly indicates which object to load.
  For instance, consider the url pattern
    path('<int:pk>/', # Matches an integer and
          views.DetailView.as_view(),
          name='detail'),

  which correspond to the view
    class DetailView(generic.DetailView):
      model = Question
      template_name = 'polls/detail.html'

  In this case, "pk" must indicate which Question to load into the view.

  But in general I don't know what they correspond to.
  Maybe "pk" is the only name that will work for this kind of View?
**** my question
Clearly the part before the : is a type, and the part after is its name.
In the case where the url leads to an ordinary function,
the value matching the pattern is passed to the corresponding argument name.
This is the case, e.g., for the line
    path('<int:question_id>/vote/', views.vote, name='vote'),
in polls/urls.py, which calls the ordinary function
    def vote(request, question_id):
in polls/views.py.

But the sequence of urlconfs might end up "calling" something that's not
an ordinary function, but instead a subtype of the View class.
This is the case, e.g., in the line
    path('<int:pk>/', # Matches an integer and
          views.DetailView.as_view(),
          name='detail'),
from polls.urls, which corresponds to the View
    class DetailView(generic.DetailView):
      model = Question
      template_name = 'polls/detail.html'
in polls.views. And the string "pk" appears nowhere in that class def!
*** each view must either
**** return an HttpResponse
which contains  the content for the requested page
**** raise an Http404 exception
*** (HTML) templates
  Templates \ Django documentation \ Django:
    https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/templates/
  To separate the design (HTML) from the code (Python) for views.
**** Calling Python code from HTML code
***** dot-lookup syntax is overloaded
 The (.) operator first tries one kind of lookup, then another ...

 "The template system uses dot-lookup syntax to access variable attributes. In the example of {{ question.question_text }}, first Django does a dictionary lookup on the object question. Failing that, it tries an attribute lookup – which works, in this case. If attribute lookup had failed, it would’ve tried a list-index lookup."
***** (at least some) Python functions are called from HTML without parens
 Example:

 `question.choice_set.all` in the template (HTML)
 is interpreted as the Python code `question.choice_set.all()`,
 which returns an iterable of (Python) Choice objects
  and is suitable for use in the {% for %} (HTML) tag.
**** the purpose: separate format from content
The functions in views.py ideally only describe content,
and leave the formatting to the templates.
That way the format of many views can be changed in one place.
**** PITFALL: the folders and namespacing for templates are confusing
 By default, DjangoTemplates looks for a `templates` folder in each installed app.
 Put the index template at `polls/templates/polls/index.html`.
 "You can refer to this template within Django as polls/index.html."
**** rendering
 One can fetch the template explicitly or implicitly:

   def index(request):
     latest_question_list = Question.objects.order_by('-pub_date')[:5]
     context = { 'latest_question_list': latest_question_list }

     # fetch the template implicitly
     return render(request, 'polls/index.html', context)

     # equivalent: fetch and render from the template explicitly
     template = loader.get_template('polls/index.html')
     return HttpResponse(
       template.render(context, request))
**** get-or-404
***** explicitdef detail(request, question_id):
   try:
     question = Question.objects.get( pk=question_id )
   except Question.DoesNotExist:
     raise Http404( "Question does not exist" )
   return render( request,
                  'polls/detail.html',
                  {'question': question} )
***** shorthand
 def detail(request, question_id):
   question = get_object_or_404( Question, pk=question_id )
   return render( request,
                  'polls/detail.html',
                  {'question': question} )
**** relative links
 polls/index.html has a passage like this (minus the comment)
     <ul>
     {% for question in latest_question_list %}
       <!--
       This would work too, but absolute links are hard to refactor.
       <li><a href="/polls/{{ question.id }}/">{{ question.question_text }}</a></li>
       The next line is better. It relies on the "detail" line in polls/urls.py.
       -->
       <li><a href="{% url 'detail' question.id %}">{{ question.question_text }}</a></li>
     {% endfor %}
     </ul>
** part 4: views, forms, gets, posts and more
*** Most of my notes are in the code, esp. these files:
(in descending order of importance | volume of edits)
polls/views.py
polls/templates/polls/*.html
polls/urls.py
*** see code
esp. templates/polls/detail_2.html
*** csrf_token
  Use these around to prevent "cross site request forgery" attacks.

  "all POST forms that are targeted at
   internal URLs should use the {% csrf_token %} template tag"

  e.g.
    <form action="..."
          method="post">
      {% csrf_token %}
      ... do stuff ...
    </form>
*** Follow every POST with a redirect.
  Always return an HttpResponseRedirect after successfully dealing
  with POST data. This prevents data from being posted twice if a
  user hits the Back button. (This advice is not Django-specific.)
