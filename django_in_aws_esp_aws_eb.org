#+title: Django in AWS (esp. AWS EB)
* PITFALL: These notes might be obsolete.
  The website was updated; now it talks about Lightsail, and never mentions Elastic Beanstalk.
* Source: Deploy a Python web app
  https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/projects/deploy-python-application
* WART: sidestepping the Python, virtualenv, NixOS headache
  AWS suggests using a virtualenv to install Django from pip.
  Python and virtualenv are confusing on NixOS:
    https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Python
  So I'm just using Docker -- specifically tax.co.
* once, run `django-admin startproject ebdjango`
  Like `stack new`, this writes a new project (filetree)
  called ebdjango to the current folder.
* from within the project, start the server, on *every* address
  python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
** PITFALL: This differs slightly from what AWS suggest
   AWS suggest
     `python manage.py runserver`
   but that uses the default address of 127.0.0.1.
   That makes sense outside of a docker container,
   but inside, the relevant address can change.
   If we instead use 0.0.0.0, we broadcast on every address at once.
** ref
   PITFALL: Take this with a grain of salt --
   `runserver`'s syntax appears to have drifted since this was written,
   unless I'm misinterpreting.
   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49476217/docker-cant-access-django-server/49476339
* if so prompted by `runserver`, run `python manage.py migrate`
* configure for Elastic Beanstalk
** PITFALL: I changed directory names
   AWS wants, confusingly, a folder called ebdjango/ebdjango.
   Instead, I named the top one python-web-app.
** TODO PITFALL: AWS-Docker compatibility
   The AWS server will need to be set up just like the tax.co Docker image.
   In particular it'll need Python 3.7.3
   (this tutorial suggests the AWS default is 3.6).
** EB will look for these files in ebdjango
*** requirements.txt
    Generate it by running this:
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
*** .ebextensions/django.config, containing this
```
    option_settings:
      aws:elasticbeanstalk:container:python:
        WSGIPath: ebdjango/wsgi.py
```
*** NOT application.py
    By default, EB would look for that.
    We've overridden that default in .ebextensions/django.config
