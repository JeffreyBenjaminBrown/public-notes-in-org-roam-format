#+title: Does CBD oil reduce cholesterol plaque?
  https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#search/cbd+oil/FMfcgzGqRZbhqsmbXrDKNcftWncSVMJK

  This product, "Proper CBD Gummies", according to someone who sounds like they want me to buy it, clears cholesterol from arteries, among other effects. But it's a mix of lots of things, not just CBD oil.

  In researching the claims in the email, I found a few papers containing both "active acid" and either "cbd" or "cholesterol". I didn't read them. Nothing that screamed out a substantial effect of one on the other in the title.
