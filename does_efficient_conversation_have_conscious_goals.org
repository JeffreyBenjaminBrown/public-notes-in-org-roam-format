#+title: Does efficient conversation have (conscious) goals?
* my doubts
** It feels disingenuous.
** It would be distracting.
** It would dull my senses.
   I want to go wherever the narrative takes us,
   unhindered by preconceptions.
* goals it might have
** what I want to know about people
*** what do they care about
*** what can they do
**** what do they know
*** who do they know
** what I want people to know about me
*** What I offer them.
**** What I've done.
**** Who I know.
*** What I care about.
*** They like hearing me talk.
**** Be funny.
**** Be interesting *to them*.
