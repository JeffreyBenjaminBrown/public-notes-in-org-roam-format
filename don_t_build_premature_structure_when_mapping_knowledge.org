#+title: Don't build premature structure when mapping knowledge.
* [[id:55dae027-0053-4557-ba7e-2a36ef679cb4][SmSn]] doesn't really need this precaution
  because there's no file|atom distinction.
* the idea
  Wait until a note has a substantial amount of stuff
  before subdividing it.
  Otherwise the data becomes hard to navigate,
  and it's likely that the categories I impose before needing them
  will turn out not to be optimal once the data reaches that size.
