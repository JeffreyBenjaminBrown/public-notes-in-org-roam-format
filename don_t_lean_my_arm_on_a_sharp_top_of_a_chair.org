#+title: Don't lean my arm on a sharp top of a chair.
<2024-10-18 Fri> I did that in order to look sideways for a long time, on a comfy leather-on-metal chair with a thin plastic back. It was uncomfortable for my arm but I didn't realize I was actually bruising internally. I still don't see the bruuise but it hurts so much 8 hours later that that's what must have happened.
