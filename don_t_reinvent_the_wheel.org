#+title: don't reinvent the wheel
* OBSOLETE
this has been copied to the SmSn mindmap, where it's easier to connect to stuff.
** Even if it seems like a dumb wheel!
 Clearly you don't want to code something that's already been coded.
 But that's rarely the choice you're given.
 Usually, going your own way means being free to do it the way you think it ought to be.
 The surprising thing is that that freedom is so often not worth having.
 Using someone else's solution not only frees your time,
 but also makes it easier for others to join you.
