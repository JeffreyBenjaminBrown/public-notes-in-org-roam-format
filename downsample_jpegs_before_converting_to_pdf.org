#+title: Downsample jpegs *before* converting to pdf.
This keeps the memory footprint small.
Converting afterward works much worse.
Convert with `convert` (imagemagick), but concat with `pdftk`.
  Concatenating pdfs with `convert` seems to waste space.
  (Using the same to concatenate non-pdfs into one pdf might be okay.)
