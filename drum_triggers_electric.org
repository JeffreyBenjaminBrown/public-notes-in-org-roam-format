#+title: drum triggers, electric
* Roland V-Drums TD-02kv, 600 USD on Sweetwater
  Has a mesh snare.
  Is the second-cheapest.
  The cheapest can't detect strike position
  and does not support rim shots.
* Roland HPD-20 (hand drum)
  = The circular, divided electric drum pad Bran owns and likes.
  He says only five of the surfaces are top-quality.
* Roland TD 1DMK
** The (cheapest?) V-Drums set.
** Includes MIDI out.
** Includes no kick pedal.
*** But there's a Sweetwater bundle that does.
