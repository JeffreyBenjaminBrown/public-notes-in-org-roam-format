#+title: Dynamic Infant Industry Protection in a Small Open Economy: A Melitz-Style Model with Learning-by-Doing - paper by Gustav P. Trommer, 2024
After "understanding it", below, there is "judging it".
**** bastard
     After I blew at least an hour on it, LCR revealed that he had whipped this off with ChatGPT o1 in 20 minutes.
* understanding it
** variables
*** i = the variety (of product?), in [0,1]
*** i = a firm, too
**** TODO huh? Is there a 1-1 correspondence between firms and varieties, with no two firms making the same variety?
*** tau_t = the tarrif at time t
*** T = a time after with the tariff = 0
    but it can be 0 before that, too
*** sigma = elasticity of substitution > 1
*** Omega_t = available varieties at time t
*** omega = an index over varieties
*** q_t (w) = consumption of w at time t
*** q_(i,t) = firm i's output at time t
*** Q_t = utility
*** P_t = "ideal price index"
*** f_D = fixed cost to produce for the domestic market
*** f_E = entry cost to "draw a productivity"
*** theta = productivity, drawn randomly per firm
*** G(theta) = the distribution of theta
*** c (theta) = marginal cost = w/theta
*** w = wage
    "later normalized to 1"
*** p* = exogenous world price
*** (1 + tau_t) p* = imported price
*** alpha > 0
*** beta > 0
*** theta_(i,t+1) = theta_(i,t) + alpha(q_(i,t))^beta
** idea
*** draw productivity, then choose whether to produce
    some of the firms pay f_E each period,
    then decide whether to produce
* judging it
** Weird that they assume a single sector.
** Weird that it's critical the elasticity of substitution be > 1.
   If it's not, the exponent in equation (1) is negative, which implies consumers are happier with less stuff.
   Also weird if one considers this in the context of an industry like steel, for which the demand seems surely inelastic -- steel is important because it doesn't have good substitutes.
** conclusion
   It would take me a long time to check their solutions but they are what I would expect -- a solution should exist, and under their assumption the firms will learn more by having more opportunity to produce.
   The structure of learning seems plausible. Initially I was skeptical of the idea that a firm would learn as much selling at a high price as they would selling from a low price, but in both conditions their incentive is to reduce costs as much as possible.
   The relationship of firms and countries to products, though, is strange to me. The utility function treats all varieties as equal. If I am to understand that these are not varieties of a single product, but rather all the products in the world, then consumers can substitute for steel with apples, which is bizarre.
   But my biggest gripe is that the tariff is protecting every good at once -- it doesn't depend on i. That makes no sense to me. It's not like a universal tariff makes more business opportunities. It makes inputs more expensive; if anything, the country is able to do less when it has a universal tariff. But supposing (as they do) it doesn't cause any businesses to fold. Those businesses were going to be doing something either way, so I don't see how the tariff helps them learn.
