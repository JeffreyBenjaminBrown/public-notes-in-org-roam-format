#+title: Effort and observation are somewhat disjunctive.
* elaboration
  To some extent one has a choice
  of how to allocate consciousness between them.
  Observation can of course be effortful,
  but it can also be effortless.
* It is tempting to tilt too heavily toward effort.
  Doing so feels bad.
  Also, at least in my experience,
  it seems often (always?) counterproductive.
