#+title: either and maybe in Python
* I like the pymonad library:
  https://github.com/jasondelaat/pymonad
** At least for maybe and either, it has no dependencies.
   It wasn't packaged for NixOS,
   so I just copied the relevant moduls it wholesale,
   and had no problems.
** demonstrating the syntax
   This test works -- and more importantly,
   if I swap the terms Left and Right, mypy complains.

   def test_either_type_signatures ():
     # This is designed to be "tested" with mypy, not pytest.
     # I just want to make sure the type signature is accepted.
     def f (b : bool) -> Either [ int, str ]:
       if b: return Left (1)
       else: return Right ("hello!")
