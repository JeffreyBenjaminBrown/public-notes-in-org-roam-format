* setting and evaluating symbols
(setq a 123)
     ⇒ 123

(eval 'a)
     ⇒ 123

a
     ⇒ 123

* self-evaluating symbols
** why they are special
   They always evaluate to themselves,
   and cannot be bound to something else.
** instances
*** nil and t
*** anything that starts with ":"
*** vectors
    These are lists in square brackets [].
* evaluating a "nonempty list form"
** The first element is not evaluated, and determines tje form's kind.
   The first step in evaluating a nonempty list is to examine its first element. This element alone determines what kind of form the list is and how the rest of the list is to be processed.
** If the first element of the list is a symbol
*** then that element is evaluated
    potentially many times, until arriving at a non-symbol.
*** what it evaluates to can be
**** a Lisp function (a lambda expression)
**** a byte-code function
**** a primitive function
**** a Lisp macro
**** a special form
**** an autoload object
* lambda syntax
  (funcall (lambda (arg) (do-something-to arg))
          '(1 2 3))
* PITFALL: Macro calls look like ordinary function calls.
  The difference is just that they are defined with defmacro,
  rather than defun.
* special forms
  https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Special-Forms.html
** Most special forms define control structures or perform variable bindings.
   Functions can't do those things.
** Each has its own rules for which arguments are evaluated.
** *instances*
*** quote
**** Prevents its list argument from being evaluated.
**** Has the shorthand of a leading quote outside of the list.
**** Can be nested
     Just as 'foo evaluates to foo,
     ''foo evaluates to 'foo.
**** PITFALL : Quotes have weird mutability implications.

     Although the expressions (list '+ 1 2) and '(+ 1 2) both yield lists equal to (+ 1 2), the former yields a freshly-minted mutable list whereas the latter yields a list built from conses that might be shared and should not be modified.
*** backquote
    is like quote but with new new abilities
**** escape parts of the list so that they are evaluated
**** splice an evaluated list into the backquoted one
     such that the result is a list all at one level,
     not a nested one
