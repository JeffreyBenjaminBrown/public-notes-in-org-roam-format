* PIFALL: might need (require '<package name>) when first installinga
  Evaluating that may have allowed me to get some packages working that otherwise weren't. But later I was able to run them without having that expression in my .emacs file.
* TODO ask about | look for
** next/previous non-whitespace
** something to show brackets, parens, etc. in another color?
** I would like the highlight to remain after changing the indentation of a lot of adjacent bullets, so that I can do it again.

* remember, commands
** `C-x space` is a better way to delineate rectangles.
** Alt-(up / down) : make two paragraphs trade places in Emacs
   similar to org-mode with bullets
** M-m: first non-whitespace char in line
** C-c C-(f/b): org next/previous same level
** Up, down and search work in the minibuffer after M-x.
* solutions
** to insert (write) date, and maybe time, at point
