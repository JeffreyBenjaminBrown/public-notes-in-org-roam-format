#+title: empathy v. communication
* When my story feels stale, focus on my audience.
  If it is a story I have repeated often,
  I often feel a tedious obligation to attend to it,
  that would feel better both for me and, surely, my audience,
  if I paid more attention to them --
  maybe particularly the implications of telling it to them.
* When my answer feels glib, try commiserating, focusing on them.
If someone complains, and I find myself explaining how I successfully handle that situation, but their complaint is one I share, make it clear that I do.
