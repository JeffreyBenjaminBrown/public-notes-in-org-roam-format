* paying them
** PITFALL: Don't use Brave!
** PITFALL: Bancolombia calls them "A Toda Hora SA"
** PITFALL: The total amount due is shown at the very end
   of the bill they email (to Sandy).
** PITFALL: I can say I'm the client.
   It seems to allow anyone who uses the service to call themselves that,
   even if the bill is not in their name.
   This saves time -- I don't have to input separate client information.

** Our ID number
   is in the top-right of every bill.
