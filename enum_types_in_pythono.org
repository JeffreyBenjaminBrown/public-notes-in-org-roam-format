#+title: enum types in Python
* PITFALL: equality between Enum types is stupid.
  Don't compare them directly.
  Instead convert them to `value`s and compare those.
* some example code
from enum import Enum, unique, auto

@unique
class Move (Enum):
    Buy  = auto ()
    ToUs = auto ()
    Sell = auto ()
    ToCo = auto ()
    def next (self) -> Move:
      # In earlier versions of Python, returning `Move` here
      # (midway through the definition of `Move`) might require
        # from __future__ import annotations
      # But as of 3.10 it doesn't.
      return Move ( ( self . value )
                      % len ( list ( Move ) )
                      + 1 )
* Weird: The type itself can be converted to a list.
