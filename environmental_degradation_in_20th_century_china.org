As a result, in the north and northwest, grasslands were opened to the plough and, with or without irrigation, winds eroded the soil and turned farmland into desert. In mountainous areas with slopes over 25 degrees forests were cut down and crops planted in rows down the slope, increasing the rate of erosion (Shapiro 2001).
