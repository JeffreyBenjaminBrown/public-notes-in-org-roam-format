#+title: exceptions in Python
* a list of builtin exceptions
  https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html
* syntax, or at least most of it
** raise error
   raise ValueError("0/0")
** try-catch
   try:
     print(x)
   except NameError:
     print("Variable x is not defined")
   except Exception as c:
     print(c)
   except: # This default clause cannot be reached,
           # because every error inherits from Exception,
           # but it is syntactically fine.
     print("Something else went wrong")
   finally: # executes whether or not an Exception arises.
     print("The 'try except' is finished")
