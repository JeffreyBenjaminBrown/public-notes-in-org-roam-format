#+title: exceptions in Python
* a list of builtin exceptions

* syntax, or at least most of it
** raise error
   raise ValueError("0/0")
** try-catch
   try:
     print(x)
   except NameError as e:
     print(e)
   except Exception:
     # PITFALL: Anything inheriting from this must come earlier.
     print("something else happened")
   except: # This default clause cannot be reached,
           # because every error inherits from Exception,
           # but it is syntactically fine.
     print("Something else went wrong")
   else:
     # *Only* executes if no Exception is found.
     # TODO: I'm not actually sure this can be mixed with "finally".
     print("No exception was found.")
   finally: # executes whether or not an Exception arises.
     print("The 'try except' is finished")
