* TODO give examples of [[id:67cc1b2b-4ec5-4012-9756-dcaafdabb41c][judiciously deleting Platonic linking nodes.]]
* PITFALL: Without being extremely explicit, these notes can turn out to be indecipherable.
  For example, what did I mean by each of the following?
** A node like x&y should be listed as an ancestor at the same level as and before x and y.
** [[id:895c50e4-60a7-4c7e-bcb5-092e1224f33e][options perpetually under considearation]]
** a how_to_read property
   example
*** Mercy is a form of [[id:6e537826-402f-4254-a40a-652b31e2390a][transcendence]].

  ** [[id:a04116d1-bd1a-4370-b036-1cbab3492281][channeling a higher [ force | power | principle ]â€‹]]
** what in that note I wish I could express
   In "gender" it's more important that the parent headline be visible than its child, but the child connects the two.
** Conversely, sometimes you want the category to come first.
   more often, I think
* How to share information among people with private information.
* a file "x & y" , if linked to files x and y, can define [a] relationship between them
* In a words graph, backward seems a better label for that direction of reading than upward.
* [[id:9b247ad4-a606-4bd4-a5a6-df297d91e262][Each node should [order, structure] its parents.]]
* DONE motivations for oscillable generations view
** The existence of [nodes in list below] makes me want to see "backward" through two levels of graph relatives from the node.
*** one and why
**** [[id:a14dd16c-0b3d-4b6f-ae1d-3dc3094155c5][immortality through identity loss & private jbb]]
**** why
     it somehow obscures what I can normally see behind a privacy graph edge (jump).
*** a second and why
**** This very [[id:37f7be50-9b2c-4426-b288-e83225b6d5d8][expressivity voids , observed]] file.
