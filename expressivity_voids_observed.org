*** represent unordered subsets, and connect every relationship to the subset consisting of its members
    If there is only one populated relationship with those members, this relationship could be skipped.
*** When relating x&y to the view z*, x&y should be listed as an ancestor at the same level as and before x and y.
    Note that z might include x or y.
**** Better: Just show x & y, but make it clear when each subexpression exists.
     This should apply to any function (e.g. "x || y & z", and make visible all relationships involving those things. (This might be represented by connecting the set {x y z} automatically to each subset if that subset itself includes any relations*

   In "gender" it's more important that the parent headline be visible than its child, but the child connects the two.
