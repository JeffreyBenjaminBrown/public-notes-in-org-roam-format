#+title: expressivity voids , observed
* A node like x&y should be listed as an ancestor at the same level as and before x and y.
* How to share information among people with private information.
* a file "x & y" , if linked to files x and y, can define [a] relationship between them
* [[id:895c50e4-60a7-4c7e-bcb5-092e1224f33e][options perpetually under considearation]]
* In a words graph, backward seems a better label for that direction of reading than upward.

* DONE motivations for oscillable generations view
** The existence of [nodes in list below] makes me want to see "backward" through two levels of graph relatives from the node.
*** one and why
**** [[id:a14dd16c-0b3d-4b6f-ae1d-3dc3094155c5][immortality through identity loss & private jbb]]
**** why
     it somehow obscures what I can normally see behind a privacy graph edge (jump).
*** a second and why
**** This very [[id:37f7be50-9b2c-4426-b288-e83225b6d5d8][expressivity voids , observed]] file.

   warn the user that there's enjoyable stuff in there,
   lest they assume it's a bummer and skip it
