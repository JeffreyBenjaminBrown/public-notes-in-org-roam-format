#+title: features I want
* lists and sets
** and maybe a generalization containing both
** [[id:b88b2b9c-b219-493b-a4a6-d3c709a6cb7b][this org-roam approximation of it]]
** why
*** search for them by any member
    Permit searching for any collection,
    rather than | in addition to
    specifally list, set, etc.,
    because you might not remember how
    you saved the collection.
*** recognize overlap, duplication automatically
    Don't permit duplication.
    Report overlap.
