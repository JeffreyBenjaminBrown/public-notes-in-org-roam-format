#+title: feeling like I forgot my homework
That dream everyone has,
being the only one naked at school,
like what is happening,
and not even recognizing until after waking up
how strange it was that nobody seemed especially to notice,
  even as I treated it as a problem to do something about
  (without attracting attention?)
