#+title: find-grep
= Find files in a folder, grep for a term in them.
* PITFALL: not just for Emacs
  It is an Emacs command.
  But [[id:b0b16d1f-105b-4825-b020-d04cb24d3649][the script it uses]] works in Bash.
* find-grep for org-roam

  find -L . -name "*.org" -exec grep --color=auto -nH --null -e expr \{\} +
** how that differs from standard find-grep
   -L = follow symlinks
   no "-type f" clause
   -name "*.org"
