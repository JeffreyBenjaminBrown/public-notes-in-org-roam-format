#+title: Fix unwanted properties problem in org-roam.
* refs
** a second, very brief discussion
   https://org-roam.discourse.group/t/org-store-link-changed-behavior-stopped-storing-org-roam-links/3747/2
** TODO the first discussion : add link to
* upshot
  In the first thread, this seemed to have solved it:
    +'(org-id-link-to-org-use-id nil)
    -'(org-id-link-to-org-use-id t)
  Indeed it made the unwanted properties drawers go away,
  when making a new file with the highlighted text as its title
  (C-c n i = org-roam-node-insert).
  But that breaks the functionality of
  adding an ID to a headline
  (C-c C-l = org-insert-link).
  Instead it just generates an ordinary org-mode link.
