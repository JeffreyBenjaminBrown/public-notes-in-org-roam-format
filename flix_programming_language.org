#+title: Flix (programming language)
* properties of Flix that I like
** first-class Datalog constraints
** Go-style concurrency
** Haskellish
*** algebraic data types
*** pattern matching
*** first-class functions
*** parametric polymorphism
*** type classes
*** higher-kinded types
*** expressions holes
** light-weight polymorphic effects
** extensible records
** a REPL
* PITFALL: Where the chapter on Datalog introduces strange keywords without explanation, just keep reading.
  That's the [chapter on Fixpoints](https://doc.flix.dev/fixpoints/).
