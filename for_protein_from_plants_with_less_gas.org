#+title: for protein from plants with less gas
* Hemp, chia and pumpkin seeds
  are borderline complete proteins,
  hemp best among them.
  Other nuts and seeds are less complete.
* Buckwheat or amaranth.
  Those, plus quinoa which I can't eat, are the plant-based sources of lysine (the limiting factor that generally prevents nuts from being complete) that I haven't tried (in decades).
