#+title: Human foragers may have been smarter than us.
"A huge amount of knowledge was needed: What you can eat, what is poisonous, what is a cure, the progress of seasons, how to deal with animals, how to deal with weather, how to make weapons, traps, or clothes. Sapiens mastered techniques for drying, smoking, freezing food. Everyone needed to know basically all of this, whereas today we can hyper-specialize. There is some evidence that our brains have *shrunk* since the age of foraging."
