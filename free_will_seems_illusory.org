#+title: Free will seems (mostly) illusory, or redefine the self.
* Solution: I am the deterministic choice process,
  and would be even if I could see all of its parts and their effects.
* Deliberation
  Do I choose any of these?
** thought
   a little
** attention
   a little
** preferences
** belief
** acts
   It feels like I choose these,
   but they arise from the others,
   which it feels like I (at least mostly) don't.
