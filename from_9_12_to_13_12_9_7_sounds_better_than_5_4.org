#+title: the sound from ~9\12 to ~13\12 can be improved
That is, improved relative to 12-edo.
* The two ways listed below, for two different edos, are very different.
  One spans 5:4, the other 9:7.
* in 46-edo, use 5:3 + 9:7 = 13:6

  major 6 chord + 13:6
  = 0  15  27  34  5'
  => these gaps:
     15  12  7   17
                 ^
	  surprisingly nice
* in 58-edo, use 12:7 + 5:4 = 28:13
