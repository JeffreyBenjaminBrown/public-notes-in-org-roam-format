#+title: relationships worth recording
* the list
** [subject] do [verb] (opt: to [argument]) under [condition]
   Condition must include time, e.g. past, future, ongoing;
   can include other qualifiers.
** [subject] stands to benefit if [statement] is true
** [author] believes [statement]
** maybe [statement]
** not [statement]
** it seems [statement]
   Implicitly, any such statement is an "it seems _ to [author]" statement.
** [statement] suggests [conclusion]]
** [statement] helps explain [statement]
** [person] wrote [statement]
** [statement] explains [argument]
** [statement] follows [statement]
** [statement] is part of [statement]
   "[_statement follows _statement] is part of [_statement]"
   can be used to represent multi-step arguments, recipes, stories
** [member] is in [category]
** [category] is subset of [bigger category]
** [action] achieves [condition]
** [condition] is goal of [agent]
   agents and authors will likely overlap
* some observations on the list
** "is true" and "is false" are better unbundled.
   "_ is true" is really a bundle of
   "[author] believes [statement]"
   and some set of "[evidence] supports [statement]" statements.
** "[author x] suspects ([author y] believes [statement])"
   is just a nesting of two relationships,
   but could be particularly useful.
