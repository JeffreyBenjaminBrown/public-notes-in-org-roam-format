#+title: relationships worth recording
* Use capital letters for the members, lowercase for the relationship template.
  The result is easy to automatically parse for relationships.
* instances
  The title of each child applies in its entirety
  to each grandchild.
**  [[id:33d5cd4e-8a0c-48f0-85c2-467db86e1862][the ternary shows-because relationship]]
** attribution : [author] said _
   Make these easy to create quickly,
   without unduly distorting the view,
   to encourage more citation.
** "_ {evinces, is implied by, ...} [statement, possibly a relationship]"
   When the object (the second member) is a relationship,
   this seems not extremely easy to represent.
*** one approach : an org-child "evidence for it" refers not to its parent, but to its entire ancestry -- why its parent is where it is in the file
**** example
   * bread
   ** needs
   *** yeast
   **** evidence for it
	without yeast it won't rise
   *** flour
   *** ...
** [[id:2a1c0d5e-81ac-46a8-a349-f3715428ac4e]["_ feels _" notes : a generalization of trigger warnings]]
** instances ^ valuable both to reader and writer
*** about these
    They would need conscious user participation,
    are whole sentences,
    and seem clearly useful to both enough authors and readers.
*** these
**** _ considers _ [adjective]
***** useful values for the adjective
****** surprising
       {surprising, beautiful, of no consequence (if | to _) ...}
****** beautiful
****** of no consequence ( if | to _ )
       This would be useful as a filter.
**** [author] {believes, suspects, suspects not, believes not} _
***** justification
      Some authors clearly want to make their beliefs known,
      and readers could benefit by seeing the distinction
      between beliefs and things that might not be.
***** suspects ~ "it seems"
      This could be a private category.
**** ([author] says) _ illuminates _
***** why no more specific than "illuminates"
      It might be helpful that the relationship
      {supports | helps explain | proves | contradicts}
      be specified no further.
      That's because, for someone who believe the first _,
      if the second contradicted it,
      contradiction could be aggregated in the view
      it serves to illuminate,
      thus preventing undue avoidance.
***** the "author says" part
      would be useful in particular to make it easy to find an author's arguments for their own claims
**** [author] wants [condition]
**** _ enjoyed reading _
     Would be useful for guiding the view.
**** [term] and [term] are equivalent.
**** _ grounds _
     It sounds better than "justifies", "clarifies", "elaborates".
** perhaps to introduce only after voting
*** user-defined relationships
    Each would have at least been considered useful by some author.
** valuable if there is voting
*** Rank these things.
    e.g. rank the things you would like to see extended,
    inc. maybe sometimes specifically by anyone who believes _
*** these things
**** _ would like to know [(aspect of) topic] (from _)
     Clearly wanted by authors,
     and readers could profit by seeing and answering well.
**** _ would like _ to read/watch _ (and state they did)
**** dubious : _ dodges the request to write about _
     Just ask them to write about another thing,
     maybe very related (more specific) to the last question.
** extractable programmatically
*** _ wrote _ (at time _)
** somewhat extractable programmatically
*** _ involves | is about _
    Generate automatically from the title:
    _ involves [{verb, noun, ...} equivalence class], etc.
*** [member] is in [category]
*** [category] is subset of [bigger category]
*** _ {if, because} _
** [writer] trusts {principle, author,}
** no pressing need; technical, not fun for mass voters
   a.k.a. garbage
   This itself might be a good category to have.
*** [statement] follows [statement] in [explanation, story, etc.]
*** [statement] is part of [statement]
    "[_statement follows _statement] is part of [_statement]"
    can be used to represent multi-step arguments, recipes, stories
*** that someone's edits on a topic were accepted by another for their version of that topic
*** [subject] <does|did|will do> [verb] (opt: to [argument]) under [condition]
    The three tenses could be unified,
    reducing three kinds of relationships to one,
    by making the tense (time) a mandatory condition,
    whereas others would be optional.
*** _ is [how to execute plan]
*** seems distasteful : [agent | project] stands to benefit if [statement]
    I already represent "if".
    Having a separate, visible-to-the-user category like
    _ stands to benefit from _
    seems like premature optimization at bbest,
    maybe no time to use.
** redundant
*** logic
**** maybe [statement]
     Implicitly, by writing "maybe x", one is saying
     "the possibility of x is worth considering".
**** not [statement]
**** it seems [statement]
     Implicitly, any such statement is an "it seems _ to [author]" statement.
*** causation
**** [action] results in [condition]
** relationships I find useful
*** defining it
*** instances of it
*** usage
*** motivation(s)
*** observations, history, stories involving, evidence for
*** fantasy
*** mysteries | problems | pitfalls (warnings)
*** todo (opportunities) | blocked (on _) | done | abandoned
*** justification (for writing about it)
*** refs. to learn about it
*** how to read [passage]
*** unsure (for atoms and relationships)
* goals of the relationship set
** Users should enjoy using it to better understand what they have written.
** Users should want to use each new symbol.
** It should be extensible, needn't be complete.
** It should be representable in a human-readable way.
* further observations
** "is true" and "is false" are better unbundled.
   "_ is true" is really a bundle of
   "[author] believes [statement]"
   and some set of "[evidence] supports [statement]" statements.
** "[author x] suspects ([author y] believes [statement])"
   is just a nesting of two relationships,
   but could be particularly useful.
* DONE obvious : inherent limitations
** A symbol made available to a user, unless voters have induced them to explicitly answer about a place where it might apply, can only symbolize "this or maybe not this".
