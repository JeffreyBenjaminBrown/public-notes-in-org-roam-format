* elevator pitch
Even the elevator pitch for why it's valuable is kind of complicated, but here's that:

Numerous corporations, most notably Google, have made truckloads of money with knowledge graphs. But knowledge graphs leave the majority of knowledge on the table, because it's unrepresentable, because it's higher-order. In a graph, edges connect nodes. Nothing can connect edges.

Relationships in Hode can have any number of members (not just two, like in a graph) and those members can themselves be relationships. It can thus represent anything.

Examples of important and irreducibly higher-order relationships include:

- Conditionality and causality: (subject <verb> object) <if | because> (subject <verb> object)
- Argument: (subject <verb> object) <supports | proves | contradicts ...> (subject <verb> object)
