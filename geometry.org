* what is a straight line
  If as a vector initially aligned with a curve is
  "parallel transported" along that curve,
  it continues to point along that curve,
  then the curve is straight; otherwise it isn't.
* what is a flat space
  non-obvious equivalents
** in terms of transport along closed curves
   If when a vector is parallel transported (completely)
   around any closed loop,
   it ends up pointing in the same direction, the space is flat.
** in terms of parallels
   If for any two curves and any two starting points,
   such that the two curves are parallel at those two points,
   parallel transporting those curves any tiny bit
   along their respective curves
   brings them to two more points where they are parallel,
   then the space is flat.
