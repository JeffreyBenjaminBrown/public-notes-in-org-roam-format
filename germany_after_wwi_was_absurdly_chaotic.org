#+title: Germany after WWI was absurdly chaotic.
* artists seized Munich
  Very shortly after World War I,
  a Jewish theater critic seized power in Munich,
  declared it an independent (fiefdom?).
  He was assassinated.
  Then a playwright and poet took power.
  His (fiefdom?) was even more of a shambles.

  These both enraged the German right, among them Hitler --
  who, of course, was himself a failed painter.
