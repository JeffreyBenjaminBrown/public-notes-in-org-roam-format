#+title: get a tattoo
* Two sets of 3 nearly-parallel lines at an angle, kind of aligned in their lengths, the two sets intersecting.
* A wireframe box with one edge and one face that would have been connected to that edge missing.
  Thus permitting one to see inside it.
  The edge can be floating nearby.
  The box should be not quite right angles.
