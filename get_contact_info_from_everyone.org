#+title: Get contact info from everyone!
* why from everyone
If in a group we start exchanging contact info, get it from everyone, unless they indicate otherwise. The cost is low and the expected gain is huge (even when a nonzero payoff is unlikely). Some people may feel slighted if they aren't included, even if I didn't initiate the exchange.
* why in both directions
  If only I have theirs, burden of first recontact is mine.
  If only they have mine, it looks like I might not actually care.
* It's okay to use a little time/processing to plan your speech at the end asking for everyone's number.
