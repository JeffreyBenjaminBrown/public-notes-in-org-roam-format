#+title: get org-roam on phone
* installing Linux on Android seems easy
  and might work better than Termux --
  e.g. letting me use encfs.

* via Termux
** PITFALL: Termux must be installed outside of the Play Store.
   The Play Store version sucks.

   It looks like the Termux Wiki recommends installing it from F-Droid,
   but when I followed their suggestions,
   I never seemed to end up using that app.
   I just downloaded an APK file for Termux and installed it,
   by clicking on it in Google Files.
** might need this hack
   https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/issues/1605#issuecomment-885997237
** install org-roam from within Emacs
** make a .emacs file
** encrypt the db
   gpg, encfs not available in Termux
** clone my git repo
* PITFALL: Git clone works for http, not weird git@ links.
  at least in Termux.
* 8" 2GHz 16GB tablet, $100
