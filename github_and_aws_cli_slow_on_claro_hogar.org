#+title: Github and AWS CLI slow on Claro Hogar
* It appears solved now.
  Github and AWS on the CLI just started working again.
  Faster than before, even, it feels like.
  No explanation given, no idea how long it'll last.
  It started working around <2022-08-01 Mon>.
* notes before it seemed to get solved
** Call this number to have someone come fix it.
   Someone recommended this:
     390 5391
   It hangs up, but first suggests this number:
     748 8888 # 3
   which got us connected to someone.
** looks like Github and AWC CLI are throttled
   but strangely, not SSH
** DONE wrong: number to identify the Github/AWS speed problem
   9193 12 546
