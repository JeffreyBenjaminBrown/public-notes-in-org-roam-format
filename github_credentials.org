#+title: Github & credentials
* the requirement
  In order to pull from GitHub*, you must have an account, and they need to verify that identity in a cryptographically secure manner.
* the procedure
  First whether there already exists an applicable public/private keypair on the machine you would like to pull to.
  https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys)

  If there isn't such a pair, create public and private keys, as described here:
  https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent

  Then upload the public key to Github, as described here:
  https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account
* I don't think this was always necessary.
