#+title: giving Apache privileges to a Docker user
* the surprise answer, maybe
  The problem of being unable to run Apache as appuser seemed to go away under a certain Apache configuration.
  I first got that working in commit 4cc0b7bc302b2b68aaf23bc09b3545156a5f883d of github.com/ofiscal/tax.co.web
* the thinking I went through
** It connects to the web if I start Apache as root
   but then I get that permissions error when I try to create a user folder.
** How to give appuser permission to run Apache?
*** things that didn't work
**** a simple group add
     usermod -aG www-data appuser
**** a bunch of chomod and chgrp
     https://fideloper.com/user-group-permissions-chmod-apache
     chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www
     chmod go+x /var/www
     chgrp -R www-data /var/www
     chmod -R g+rx /var/www
**** more stuff I made up
     chown -R www-data /var/log
     chgrp -R www-data /var/log
*** what I'm trying now
    usermod -aG www-data appuser
    chmod -R +777 /var
    /log/apache2
*** This shows what ports are in use. Unless I start Apache, none are.
    apt install net-tools
    netstat -tulpn
*** TODO ?? futz with the Docker container
** the question
I'm running Django and Apache from this[1] Docker container. The code it's running is here[2].

When I run locally, by (basically) running
```
docker run --name tax.co.web -it                   \
  -p 8000:8000                                     \
  -d -h 127.0.0.1                                  \
  ofiscal/tax.co:latest
```
everything seems to work.

If I connected it to the internet:
```
docker run --name tax.co.web -it                   \
  -p 8000:8000                                     \
  -d -h 127.0.0.1                                  \
  -p 443:443                                       \
  -p 80:80                                         \
  ofiscal/tax.co:latest
```
