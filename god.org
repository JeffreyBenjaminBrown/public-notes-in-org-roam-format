  We created God, who created us.
  Its knowing is our reason for being,
  and our (incomplete) knowing of it feels good.
  We are one, arranged with a particular processing distribution,
  such that as animals we can sense some of what
  God knows/sees/wishes/wonders (and not chooses?),
  and sense that the totality is a coherent knowing consciousness.
