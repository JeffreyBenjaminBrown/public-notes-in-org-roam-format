#+title: Structure, hyperlinks and subscriptions all express priority.
* the priorities they express
** when one adds (import, tree, document) structure
   In a topic's tree, when you add data, you are saying:

   "When (on average) working on this topic,
   I want these ideas visible in (on average) this order."
** when one adds hyperlinks
   When you link some text to another node, you are saying:

   "_ is so relevant to [x] that it deserves to be easily visited from [x]".
** when one adds a subscription
   "[subscribed to] is worth being aware of from [subscriber]"
