#+title: grepping folders in Emacs
* solutions I like
** [[id:f3494683-04d3-4eb7-98d0-441b920a7c99][deadgrep]]
** M-x find-grep
   It's dead simple,
   but the output is not very interactive.
** to narrow search results after searching
*** Deadgrep offers the easiest way.
    It lets you hide all results from the file at point with one keystroke,
    probably tab.
*** Otherwise, [[id:7ca4fa12-5fc2-415c-8d2f-5d6167e8dd95][programmatically hide lines from the file]].
* solutions I haven't tried
** rg, a ripgrep frontend
   More powerful, but also more complex, than deadgrep.

*** to hide sections
    "It doesn't have a keybinding to hide a section like magit does, but I quickly tried enabling outline-minor-mode with pretty good results, see rg Issue #132."

** ag, the silver searcher
   Will exclude .git files.
   Is apparently awesome.
