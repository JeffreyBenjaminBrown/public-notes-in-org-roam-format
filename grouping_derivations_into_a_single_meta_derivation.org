#+title: grouping NixOS derivations into a single meta-derivation
* ref
  https://discourse.nixos.org/t/where-can-i-locate-all-my-downloaded-lv2-ladspa-and-etc/31810
* the trick: symlinkJoin
# in packages.nix:
#+BEGIN_SRC nix
{ pkgs, ... }:

{
  environment.systemPackages =
    with pkgs; [
      ...
      (symlinkJoin {
        name = "jbb-plugins";
        paths = [
          drumgizmo
	        ...
          ] } ) ] }
#+END_SRC
* what it does
  It will install the contained packages (e.g. drumgizmo above)
  normally, but also create a "metapackage"
  containing each package listed in the `symlinkJoin` statement.
  By listing this metapackage,
  rather than the entire `/nix/store` path,
  one can save software that searches for plugins (like Reaper)
  a lot of time.
