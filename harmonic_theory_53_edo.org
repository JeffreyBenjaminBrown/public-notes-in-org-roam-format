* how far to take its harmonics
** It certainly does not reach the 29th harmonic.
   29 / 16 is indistinguishable from 9 / 5,
   and terribly approximated.
** It arguably does not reach the 23rd harmonic.
   23 / 16 is indistinguishable from 13 / 9,
   and much worse approximated,
   though not terribly -- +6c error.
   Since 13 / 9 is such a weird unfamiliar interval,
   I'm not sure this should be a concern.
   Or maybe the more important concer is
   whether the 23rd harmonic deserves to be considered *ever*.
   I suspect the answer is no: [[id:9cdeafc9-698c-43b1-b02c-88062ea298dc][harmonic 23 is not worth it.]]
