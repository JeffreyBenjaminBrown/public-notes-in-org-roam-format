#+title: hash (algorithm)
* hash a folder recursively in Bash, how to
  find -type f \( -not -name "md5sum.txt" \) -exec md5sum '{}' \; | sort > md5sum.sorted.txt
  The sorting is useful because find does not to always produce results in the same order. (At least the one time I tried this on two big folders on different hard drives, that was evident.)
