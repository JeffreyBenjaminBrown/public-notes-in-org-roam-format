#+title: Have Rust act on the s-exp from Emacs.
* DONE Translate an s-exp into a Vector<OrgBranch>
* Rust modifies the filetree.
** PITFALL: work rootward
   This has to be done starting from the leaves.
   Their containers cannot be modified until they exist.
** updates
   If any of the text or content has changed,
   update the file. Otherwise don't touch it
   (to avoid updating its timestamp).
** new files
   If any heading was missing an ID, give it one.
   Create it in the filetree.
   Update its ID in the Vector<OrgBranch>.
* Keep a list of files modified and added.
* Update TypeDB
  Include each new file,
  and update each file whose
  content *or links* has changed.
* [[id:e707ded7-ff36-41cf-8ae1-672ab78e30d4][saving should bring a new document from Rust]]
  invisibly
* Orphaned content becomes uncontained, not deleted.
