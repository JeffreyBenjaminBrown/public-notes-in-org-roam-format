** On personal change
*** At 42 I acclimated physically (and behaviorally) to Villavo.
    The first and maybe the second time I was here, I was somewhat useless.
    The heat was opressive, and I got sick a lot.
    This time I have a fan on me most of the time,
    I'm working like normal or more,
    I can exercise,
    and while I got a stomach bug for a few days at the start,
    I've been fine for the four weeks since.
*** paraphrased: "Nobody comes back changed from an amazing vacation in Hawaii. It's suffering that does that."
**** -- David Brooks, on Tyler Cowen's podcast, circa 2019?
** Counting words depends on what im reading
*** If im really into it, I don't.
*** I ?never do when reading my own notes.
