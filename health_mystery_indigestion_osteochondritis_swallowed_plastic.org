#+title: health mystery : indigestion? osteochondritis? swallowed plastic?
* story
After doing heavier than normal chest exercises, I feel like I swallowed a piece of plastic, and all sorts of skeletal pain around my chest. I want to know if the one caused the other.

I thought I had swallowed something plastic, but it went away, and then came again a day or two later -- this time after swallowing some metformin badly before bed, and lasting through at least now, the next morning.
