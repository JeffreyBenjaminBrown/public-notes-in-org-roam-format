#+title: hike from El Tablazo to Supata
* Tony suggests
* How he describes it
start at el tablazo and hike down to Supata (I think).  Best to get a guide as there are no markings (we tried and did a loop, but I have found that the strava map for some reasons shows it)

if you want a local hike.  The start is near subachoque

or since you are young, hike up! ðŸ™‚

IF (a big if only once no clouds) there are no clouds, the view from el tablazo is amazing.

I mean the trails are well worn, but split often!

so if you dont have a good map....
