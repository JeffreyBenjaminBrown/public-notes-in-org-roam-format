#+TITLE: Hode
* u <2024-09-02 Mon>
** Cancel culture exploits the internet. It would be good if hod were difficult to exploit in similar ways.
** ForcEd mixing of political views?
** Breadcrumbs: starting from
        nothing, what can you believe?
*** Make paths through subjects (math, etc.), explaining how to check each claim.
** Be able to make queries like "does this person only produce content with a political slant?"
** Twitter tried deemphasizing followed count and letting people subscribe to t√≥pica rather than people
** Facebook tried the oversight board.
** Along with like button, true/false buttons
** Warn friends, appointed as one of their editors, if a joke seems dangerous
** A private dislike button
** Belong to multiple communities, each with their own currency, and you can exchange one for the other. In this way communities can gobble each other, in a way that enables algorithms that people enjoy more to dominate.
** Pull your resources with friends to scour the internet in a particular way.
** Intimacy is permissions
** For people to record "you seem to believe _" could be helpful to you, as well as to them.
** The resources available for contribution are computation, memory, data transfer (to and from their own systems) and maybe money. And owning a share of the network means owning exactly those. Maybe there should be multiple currencies for each network, e.g. a memory one, a computation one, etc.
** Someone should be able to say how they honestly feel
** Can a bot lens the discussion into Spanish? I know smart Spanish speaking lawyers, journalists, etc.
** Diversity of opinion makes objectivity easier.
   For instance, when psychology was more homogeneous, it was widely accepted that homosexuality was an illness.
