** Forced mixing of political views?
** Breadcrumbs: Starting from nothing, what can you believe?
*** Make paths through subjects (math, etc.), explaining how to check each claim.
** Belong to multiple communities, each with their own currency, and you can exchange one for the other. In this way communities can gobble each other, in a way that enables algorithms that people enjoy more to dominate.
** Pull your resources with friends to scour the internet in a particular way.
** The resources available for contribution are computation, memory, data transfer (to and from their own systems) and maybe money. And owning a share of the network means owning exactly those. Maybe there should be multiple currencies for each network, e.g. a memory one, a computation one, etc.
