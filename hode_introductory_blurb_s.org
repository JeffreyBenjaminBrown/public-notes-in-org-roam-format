#+title: Hode introductory blurb(s)
* extremely short blurbs
  These descriptions overlap.
** [[id:ee8ecb15-832c-410f-8eed-f097baaba85e][Hode in under 295 characters, for the Mercatus Center]]
** [[id:c913fad2-0de2-4876-9923-9181b5bf479b][Hode in under 700 characters]]
* [[id:d38cfd40-25df-4662-a455-b926aa449dfa][Hode would resemble a mix of familiar applications.]]
* [[id:b810eec1-847b-4cbe-a2d8-cd628eb9a95c][Why not just use those apps that already exist?]]
* [[id:aef27d75-d7c3-4182-aa86-51edcc522b4c][why Hode is feasible]]
* The data structure and query language would make it special.
  It would allow people to easily record not just statements, but statements about other peoples' statements, in a structure that permitted queries more advanced than what search engines enable currently. For instance, "Show me statements made about topic X by authors X and Y that coincide -- that is, X and Y have both said the same thing about it."
