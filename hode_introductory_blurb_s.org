#+title: Hode introductory blurb(s)
* what it would be like
  It would be an open-source (not for profit, nor controlled by any central authority), distributed system combining features of all of the following kinds of applications:
** knowledge-sharing platforms (Wikipedia, Elsevier)
** content-sharing platforms (Youtube, Twitter)
** search engines (Google)
** configurable editors (Emacs, VSCode)
** data exploration platforms (Tableau)
* The data structure and query language would make it special.
  It would allow people to easily record not just statements, but statements about other peoples' statements, in a structure that permitted queries more advanced than what search engines enable currently. For instance, "Show me statements made about topic X by authors X and Y that coincide -- that is, X and Y have both said the same thing about it."
