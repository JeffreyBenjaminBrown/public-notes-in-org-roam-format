** It would be useful if authors could say of each other's statements things like this made me laugh, this surprised me, this I agree with.
*** Also this needs evidence, or a conclusion, or suggestions for further reading. I don't know whether those should be private or public.
** Let people log their queries globally. The register analyzes what people are trying to know, and uses that to determine what relationships to prompt for

** Asking TypeDB: Sort on transitive partially applied rels?

** parsing in Python
   I like the look of these:
     https://pypi.org/project/parsita/ -- my favorite, judging the docs
     https://github.com/vlasovskikh/funcparserlib
     https://pypi.org/project/parsy/
   and at least the spirit behind
     https://pypi.org/project/parsec/
** Emacs dev handbook

** interpreting JSON in Emacs
   The regular Emacs as packaged on Nix has no JSON support.
   Does Doom Emacs?
   https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs
** What guarantees uniqueness in TypeDB?
   There seems to be an automatically-created "iid" field.
** Asking about state in Emacs
   https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1dgxlmh/where_do_you_keep_state_when_writing_a_big_emacs/
*** someone rec's
    Sticking things in symbols' property lists with put (and later retrieving those values with get) can work nicely sometimes.
    Maybe a hash map.
*** someone else rec's
    Private variables would be typically hode-state--* (too dashes). Public names are usually single-dashed.

    If you have a bunch of internal variables representing some state, I don't think you should be shy of using structures (with defstruct) or classes. Defstruct is convenient since you get bunch of default methods so you don't have to type them yourself.
*** another
    buffer overlay
    text properties
    fields in text/buffers
    anything about the buffer variable and storage systems

** How to extend it to involve Emacs
   Emacs reads the file as Python updates it.
   The user does not edit the file directly,
   but can fold, unfold, etc. directly from the text,
   and enter Hash-like commands into a separate buffer.
   The file includes very brief URIs, their visibility togglable,
   allowing users to refer to nodes quickly.
* Minimum viable extensible product

** First just the "is in some sense child of" relationship.
** From Emacs you can
*** search for text and be rewarded with candidate nodes
*** fold and unfold children
*** change node text
*** add children
*** delete child relationships
*** delete whole nodes
    with warnings about how many children it has,
    and how many will be orphaned
** Use Emacs, Python and TypeDB
** Emacs writes Python programs and writes buffers to files, which Python and maybe TypeDB can read
** Python writes programs for TypeDB, reads the results, and writes instructions for Emacs to update
** Mostly Python, not Emacs, keeps track of what things mean.
   Emacs has hidden text that says which text corresponds to which graph object.
   But Python has the representation of the buffer -- what search was run, which nodes are children of what, etc.
   Emacs updates by reading a file Python produces, and hiding appropriate text.

* IO
** run a TypeDB script in Docker, outputting to a text file
** Associate regions of Emacs buffer to TypeDB objects.
** Communicate between Emacs and TypeDB.
   Maybe just write TypeDB shell scripts automatically in TypeDB,
   run them in the Docker container, write to a file,
   and read that file in Emacs.
** Communicate between Emacs and Docker.
   Maybe use the TypeDB Python driver,
   installed via pip,
   in the same Docker container that runs TypeDB.

** It would be nice if it could be WYSIWYG
*** It can't, but at least some items could be feline able as editable
**** When edited, one would have to choose whether they are replacing that thing with a new thing, or changing that thing in every other place it appears too
** I'll need to choose some important relationships and types
*** Types
**** Source (of information)
**** Verb
**** Noun
*** Relationships
**** Source considers information to be of quality
**** Does
** Each buffer will need a data model
*** Wherever the cursor is must correspond to an object meaningful in the graph, which means the buffer must have hidden data relating the text to graph objects
