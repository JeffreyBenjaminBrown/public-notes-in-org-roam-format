#+title: Houses used to be so cold that people tried to use the kitchen for everything.
* The kitchen was the one room whose temperature could differ suubstantially from the ambient one outside.
* People heated bricks to keep in or under the bed.
* Baths were necessarily public events, because one had to drag a tub into the kitchen and heat water for it over the stove.
