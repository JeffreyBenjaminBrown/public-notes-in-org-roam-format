#+title: How did I break a MIDI track in Reaper?
It won't produce audio.
It's the first track in my last project from 2023.
* PITFALL: It's easy to mistake this for a failure of JACK.

  But JACK is clearly working,
  because another Reaper project is working,
  as is SuperCollider --
  and if I disable one of the wires in the JACK graph,
  the stereo image is affected as would be expected.
