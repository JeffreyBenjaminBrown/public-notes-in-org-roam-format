#+title: How do I keep getting talked into watching horror films?
* I have never enjoyed one.
* theories
** Not reading the reviews closely enough to recognize it has elements of horror.
   which I do to avoid anything resembling a spoiler
** Trusting friends' judgment
   without having even discussed with them that I hate horror films
