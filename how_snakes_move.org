* how snakes move
** a source
*** https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AKPFiIEEw&pp=0gcJCfwAo7VqN5tD
** Rectilinear: depends on loose belly skin
** Sidewinding
*** Good for when surface is hard to grip, sand, ice
*** Lateral displacement, but they turn the head to look in the direction of movement
*** Is like walking. They pick parta of themselves up, using three anchor point feet.
** Concettina
*** Acordion
** Serpentine -- push off something, looks magic
*** Consider a point where the snake bends, the tailward part extending off to the right, and the headward part also extending off to the right, at roughly 90Â° to each other. Headward of the bend, the snake can push off of the contact made at the bend, straightening itself to move farther in the headward direction.
