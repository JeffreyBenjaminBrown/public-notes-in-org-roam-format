#+title: How to Change Your Mind, Michael Pollan
* That famous first picture of the Earth from outer space is comparable to the realizations one has on a psychedelic, and that you don't really gain new information, but seeing it makes it real.
* Acid in the 1960s was a new kind of rite of passage, because the earlier generation had no idea what it was. Prior to that, rights of passage tended to knit society together, but this did the reverse.
* The drug company (Sandos?) that owned LSD initially thought that it could provide an understanding of alcoholism by simulating delirium tremens. But whereas delirium tremens is horrible, most of the reported experiences from people who tried the drug where at least in part beautiful.
* By end of 50s, LSD was widely regarded as a miracle cure for alcoholism. By the 90s that body of research was virtually unknown to doctors.
