* who to complain to
  To someone not entangled in the same problem.
  Not to your boss, or to colleagues below you in the org. chart
* Complain objectively, including your own feelings but not others'.

  For example, instead of saying, “Bob was rude,” note that Bob interrupted you, and that made you feel like he doesn’t have confidence in your work.
* Keep it off-screen.
