#+title: How to configure Linux to use an internet proxy via cntlm.

  serial
** once, supposedly
*** install cntlm
    Download the latest .deb package from ubuntu.com.
*** configure most of /etc/cntlm.conf
    Domain = get it from my admin
    User = "
    Proxy = x.x.x.x:8080
      # where each x is a number;
      # get it from my admin
    NoProxy = ...
      # The admin might have a list of exceptions.
      # If not, probably can leave this at its default value.
    Listen = 3128
*** see if that works
    run
      cntlm -M http://www.google.com
    It should prompt me for an invisible password,
    and then connect.
*** give it password hashes
    run
      cntlm -H
    It should prompt me for an invisible password,
    and then display more text to copy into cntlm.conf
** every time, maybe

*** restart cntlm
**** on ordinary Linux, I think, do this
     sudo systemctl restart cntlm
**** in WSL
     sudo service cntlm restart
*** export http_proxy and https_proxy
    export http_proxy=http://localhost:3128/
    export https_proxy=http://localhost:3128/
