#+title: how to do coding problems fast
* Review pitfalls in the language to be used.
* Fear not the debugger.
  (if the language has one)
* Keep separate `lib`, `util` and `tests` files.
  Don't call lib main, just in case.
  Keep util separate from tests so that
  I can more easily interactively test in the REPL,
  by copying nothing but import statements from the test suite.
* Optimize only the big things.
  Find a good algorithm,
  but don't both making special cases of that algorithm faster.
