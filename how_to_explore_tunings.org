* [[id:ab252872-f79a-474e-b336-b795b093079c][PITFALL: A gauge's "ideal tension" considers both timbre and feel.]]

  The most natural, default Stick player position
  is with the left hand on the bass
  and the right hand near it on the treble.
  If they are to be in two corresponding 41-edo "rainbow zones",
  then (if memory serves)
  those two rainbow zones should be separated by about 8 frets (16\41).
