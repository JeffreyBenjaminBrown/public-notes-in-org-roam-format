#+title: how to form a study group
* SOURCE : Largely asking ChatGPT
  to sum up the research.
* Self-selected groups (tend to)
** enjoy the experience more.
** underperform the alternative.
   "Instructor-assigned or algorithmic groups (mixed skill, random, or balanced by GPA, gender, etc.)"
   The best-performing groups were "thoughtfully balanced", rather than random, but even random outperformed self-selection.
** early on, have more comfort, cohesion and communication.
** lower initial coordination cost.
** plateau earlier.
** have less diverse ideas and skills.
   It wasn't clear that they meant only "friends or familiar peers"
   or whether that was just an illustration.
** avoid conflict and role differentiation.
* "Explicit discussion of roles early on improves outcomes regardless of formation method."
* With time group cooperation improves.
* overlapping interests
* specialization
** kinds
*** in subject area
*** in role

** Roles are better at least someowhat fluid.
   Indeed formally rotating roles can work well.
** It can emerge without being named.
** Subject area expertise is more helpful if known.
   If everyone knows you can ask X about T,
     that makes T's specialization in X more useful.
* problems
** "diffusion of responsibility"
** "coordination overhead"
* Some tasks have more potential for specialization.
  complementarity
* Over-specialization feels narrow-minded.
