#+title: how to get IP and MAC addresses in Linux
* Know which subsystem I need info on.
** If I'm being asked for the wired connection, read the entry under `eno1`.
** If I'm being asked for the wireless connection, read the one under something that starts with `wlp`.
**
* run `ifconfig`
  Actually, some people online say that's deprecated,
  and one should use `ip` instead.
* read its output
** The IPv4 address appears after `inet`.
   After `broadcast` is something similar but probably not what I want.
** After `inet6` is the IPv6 address.
** After `ether` is the MAC address.
   Those, uniquely, are formatted like `f0:d5:bf:01:6e:13`.
   That's six pairs of hex digits.
