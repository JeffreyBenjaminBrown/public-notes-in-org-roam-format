#+title: how to manually balance the pressure in the ear
* PITFALL: Take [[id:ff009615-b90a-4cec-a645-c916f148bcb9][decongestants]] sufficiently in advance.
* As soon as I detect a drop in altitude,
  (i.e. an increase in pressure outside the ear),
  plug nose and blow.
  Do this early and often so that I never have to blow hard.
  Otherwise the drum could be damaged.
* What it sounds like
** If the pressure change is not extreme, it sounds like tightening a sheet.
** If the eustachian tube is tight, clearing your ears can sound like a dolphin.
