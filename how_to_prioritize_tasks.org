#+title: how to prioritize tasks
* the three questions
** What is its deadline?
** How much does it pay off?
*** Will it help with other priorities?
** What does it cost?
*** Time
*** Money & other resources
*** Psychic/emotional budget
*** Political capital
* difficulty: probability
  Costs, benefits and even deadlines
  are usually probability distributions,
  not fixed scalar values.
