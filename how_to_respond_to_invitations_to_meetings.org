#+title: How to respond to invitations to meetings?
* Ask for an agenda, and read it and respond early, before saying yes to a meeting.
* why
  Even though I won't say no,
  this gives an opportunity to say what I don't need to know.
  It's easier (psychologically) for them to omit that content
  if they haven't yet planned in detail how to present it,
  and it's kinder with their time.
