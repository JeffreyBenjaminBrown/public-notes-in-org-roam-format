#+title: How to respond to invitations to meetings?
* Ask for an agenda, read it and respond, early.
* why
  multiple reasons
** Lets me ditch, or help them reduce its scope.
   Even if I say yes,
   this gives an opportunity to say what I don't need to know.
   It's easier (psychologically) for them to omit that content
   if they haven't yet planned in detail how to present it,
   and it's kinder with their time.
** Lets me help them focus it
   at least in the event that it's entirely for me
   -- which has happened at least once in a way that
   took me by surprise.
