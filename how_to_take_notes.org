** If it seems too far-out to share, [[id:ccc1c640-f36e-47de-b417-a12ea267f0a2][ground the claim]].
** Never have a hidden category.
   i.e. never skip a category, leave a grandchild unlabeled in its grandparent
   Why: omitting levels in the ontology can lead to unreadably long, flat documents.
** [[id:c774af85-7ad0-4762-b28c-5e02d4881c8b][After filing something, know the whole note it went into.]]
** Read fast, some things just above zero time-weight.
** A negative is often equivalent to a more specific positive.
   [[id:d53dd756-cc2f-43f9-a919-5f39810e642c][example]] (of "Note titles should be positive and specific.")
** If I find myself stuck trying to place it perfectly, move on.
   It's in there, after all.

** [[id:ccc1c640-f36e-47de-b417-a12ea267f0a2]["Grounded claims" are cool.]]
** the para method
 https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/
*** stands for "projects, areas (of responsibility), resources, archives"
 I would just say "responsibilities" instead of "areas (of responsibility)"
*** archives are inactive things from the other three categories
*** areas v. projects
**** to have an area is to (try to) maintain a standard
 e.g. health, finance, spouse
**** projects belong to areas, and are supposed to end
*** Seeing projects come and go helps [[id:7b52eb18-91c5-4f83-be4f-40ff8a918541][motivation]].
** evergreen notes
*** file by concept > file by {resource, project, event ...}
** Note titles should be positive and specific.

    "X doesn't work" can often be replaced with "Y requires Z".
*** Negative titles are less actionable.
** Note titles should be complete sentences (when possible).

*** So look up!
*** probably me paraphrasing Andy Matuschak
    Knowing A is related to X is good.
    But if X is a long passage,
    it's more helpful for A to link to a specific part of X,
    and for that part of X to be visible from A.
**** source: Andy Matuschak calls this "fine-grained association".

*** ref, where I got the idea
    https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z2newCwFfd6iZFyf9bgspkbyt1G8wbQxJVgTK
* why
** Use notes to avoid preconceived conclusions.
   Writing an essay top-down implies the writer decides the conclusion first, and then tries to argue it. That's absurd!

** Externalizing ideas frees working memory, enhances focus.
https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z6C5H4eYH2A4omfNLuUcDiKibQ1hZG2RGNZ97
** passive reading|listening is (usually?) wasteful
   Think, ask questions about it, write, investigate other branches;
   don't feel obligated to keep following
   someone else's train of thought.
*** a reference with other refrences
 https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zX1WtJ4ouE8sjN1NgWHsGVg8ZnVfp5Kz74Vs
*** 100% reading, 0% processing => nowhere
 Schopenhauer saw this:
 "whoever reads very much and almost the whole day, but in between recovers by thoughtless pastime, gradually loses the ability to think on his own ...
 constant reading immediately taken up again in every free moment is even more mentally paralysing than constant manual labour, since in the latter we can still muse about our own thoughts. But just as a coiled spring finally loses its elasticity through the sustained pressure of a foreign body, so too the mind through the constant force of other peopleâ€™s thoughts."
** The returns to well-linked notes compound.
   => Notes work that feels like a waste of time might not be.
