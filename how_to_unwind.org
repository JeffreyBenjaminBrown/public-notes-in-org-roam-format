#+title: how to unwind
* steps, elements
** Recognize its importance.
   Without unwinding at the end of the day,
   I sleep worse, and I am less productive the next day.
   The cumulative effect is particularly bad.
** Stop "working". Change focus.
*** Can "work" on more enjoyable things, esp. social relationships,
*** but cease whatever might have been considered the day's tedium.
** Relax. Choose freedom.
*** Be forgiving, of self and other.
*** Feel free to switch focii in whatever way feels good.
    Today's time for diligence has passed.
** Think about feelings, relationships.
** Cultivate awe, wonder, gratitude, optimism.
