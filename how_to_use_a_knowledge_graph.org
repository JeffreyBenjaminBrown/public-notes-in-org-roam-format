   don't feel obligated to keep following
   someone else's train of thought.

*** 100% reading, 0% processing => nowhere
 Schopenhauer saw this:
 "whoever reads very much and almost the whole day, but in between recovers by thoughtless pastime, gradually loses the ability to think on his own ...
 constant reading immediately taken up again in every free moment is even more mentally paralysing than constant manual labour, since in the latter we can still muse about our own thoughts. But just as a coiled spring finally loses its elasticity through the sustained pressure of a foreign body, so too the mind through the constant force of other peopleâ€™s thoughts."
** The returns to well-linked notes compound.

** Is appending usually better than prepending?
   alternative | competing strategies
*** add to the bottom, if you'll read from the top, to read it all
    Adding a new note to the end seems better than adding to the start.
    That's because you're going to read the note from top to bottom.
    If new things go to the top you might never find the old things.
*** clarify early (at the top) to the reader how to read the file

*** Duties to yourself
**** If you (habitually) write to it, revise it.
***** A note accreted to and then observed as a collection might reveal itself to be a bad idea this way.
      How that happens is fun, and probably worth understanding.
**** Write diverse things.
***** topic
***** kind of analysis: goal, methods, consequence, level of abstraction
**** Qualify your opinions.
     Some things you believe. These can go unqualified.
     But if it's a suspicion, something you doubt, etc. make that clear.
**** Employ atomicity.
     in Andy Matuschak's sense
**** Provide enough context.
     Many (most interesting?) two-member labeled relationships illuminate more than three concepts.
**** Aim for universality, at least sometimes.
     More universal = more people who might find the idea useful.
**** Dare to record your insights.
     In short time, revising them will surprise you.
*** Duties to others.
**** Dare to imagine others want your insights.
**** Dare to imagine you need others' insights.
**** Download, read and link to other peoples' notes.
** less (than hypotheses)
*** Sermons repeat. Branch lists could repeat, or more generally include musical instructions.
**** Scalars like "mass" or "value".
* aspirations
** Discover an ant-like algorithm.
* u
** interpretations of punctuation
*** () is optional, whereas [] and {} are mandatory but perhaps holding disjunctive options
*** add a comma to indicate plurality, even if there is only one member
    singleton (without a comma) lists and sets seem equivalent
** ordering branches
   schemes
*** bubble up from the bottom until indifferent
    Add a new idea to the bottom of the list, then raise it,
    until it's not obviously better than the thing above it.
*** ideas about being > ideas about doing
    This is a spectrum, not a binary.
    This pattern, like any pattern,
    will likely manifest fractally throughout the tree.
*** [[id:cf2e9be0-dd55-4f08-84fd-7d456faee1a1][a tentative universal order for branch lists]]
** My "technical" label seems ambiguous.
   It could be about mechanisms with or without associated goals.
   Maybe I should split it into "mech" and "use".
** An "about the order of these branches" branch, first among them.
*** possibilities include "serial", "alternatives", ..
    alternatives perhaps unordered, or ordered by likelihood, ..
*** Generalization: A branch about a tree's structure.
    But I'm not sure I would use that freedom.
* A valid read technique is to read the whole file before deciding which links to follow.
  Has the advantage (?) of making it possible to know what you read, which might make it easier to review more of your graph.
  Has the disadvantage of slowing down how fast you move across files, by forcing a complete read of each before moving on.
* a read-write equilibrium
** good arrangement requires knowing how you read, and vice-versa
   e.g. if you know you'll read from the top down and from root to leaves, then your choices of what is how high, what is nested, and what is behind a link are all important.
* ? Give everything a context.
* Maybe don't start new roots.
  Instead, start from inside a document,
  and then maybe add contexts and separate it.
** not sure
   Should everything new graft onto a historical context,
   even if one is always in easy reach?
* Maybe always read backlinks* before reading content.

* losing track of notes is optimal
  Don't worry about losing conscious track of any note -- losing track is, in fact, critical to successful usage of a knowledge graph.
  Even if you perfectly anticipate and curate the set Y when you create the new note, it's possible that you won't look up anything in Y for a long time. That's fine! Continuing the above example, suppose the note you wrote was about love and how to avoid burnout at work, and you put it under those two things, and then never looked at those two things. That means those two things weren't an issue for you.
* Be clear on the purpose.
  Shuffling mindmaps is not something I do for the mindmap's sake!
  It is how I think.
* Remember that I like rewriting my notes.

*** the idea
    Check out notes that link to what you're reading.
*** why
    When you visited the current file -- say, "how to program in Python" -- it's likely not because doing that was your motivation per se, but rather some bigger project was, like "programming". And the latter probably links to the former. Looking "upward" will bring it into view, and thereby both remind you of your larger purpose(s) and of context and methods relevant to those purposes.
* learn to search your notes
  If the note exists, usually it's not hard to find -- even if you didn't curate its parents well, you can grep your folder for relevant terms.

** deliberation
*** the lead ? and the trailing ?
**** first = big
**** last = read last sometimes but nearly first others
**** first and last in a branch list
     The big ? is conceptual, the little ? unsure about and maybe worth the highlight of being last. But if it's last there should be a garbage nearby.
** conclusion
   The ? near (at?) the top of the branch list is conceptual, fundamental in a way that could if understood upset the order of the other branches.
   The ? near the bottom, if any, is dubious but worth the highlight. It can also be a dubious branch of the early ? branch.
   There should be a "bury" branch near the end. Not everything deleted has to go there but probably a lot should, because maybe we'll have the processing power to incorporate all the data including those burials.

* to-merge buckets
** which one
*** There should always be a "recent, unmerged, serial as written" bucket at the end of the sorted list, to put new things without having to disturb train of thought elsewhere.
*** Always append at the end, and order from the top.
    And mark the last node to be ordered.
    More generally, keep a list of line unmbers when nodes were visited in each file. A frequent enough git commit history would have this property.
