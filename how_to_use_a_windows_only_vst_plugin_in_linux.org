#+title: how to use a Windows-only plugin in Linux
This applies at least to VST plugins,
but I suspect it works for other formats, too.
* [[id:51358dbf-6c5c-42a2-b44e-76128b763857][PITFALL: `yabridgectl sync` might need redoing for new .]]
* steps, in serial
** install Wine, and maybe other things
   e.g. winetricks
** install a "bridge"
   "yabridge" might be easiest.
   There are a few.
** install the plugin in Wine
   ChatGPT suggests running the following (from Bash?):
     wine setup_vst.exe
   Choose a target folder like
     ~/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/VSTPlugins
** inform the bridge of the new plugin
*** If using yabridge, run `yabridgectl sync`
**** PITFALL: This might need to be done each time I add a VST.

** choose a VST host to run on Linux
   e.g. a DAW like Reaper
** add the Wine VST folder to what the VST host scans
