#+title: How (unsolved) to rank chords in an EDO by harmonicity
* "Chord Complexity" @ Xenharmonic Wiki
  https://en.xen.wiki/w/Chord_complexity
* measuring just ratio complexity
** height functions
   https://en.xen.wiki/w/Height
** two simple ones
   log(n*d)
   sopfr(n*d) -- sopfr is the sum of prime factors
* It's hard!
  Even with a good function from EDO interval to complexity, a monotonically increasing function from a chords' compnent ratios' compexities isn't good enough.
  Among other reasons, that's because sometimes an imaginary fundamental fuses them.
