#+title: Humans spread from Alaska to all of the America in 4k years.
"Sapiens got to America around 16kya. This was even more impressive. Yes, they walked over from Asia because sea levels were low. But they had to adapt to the extreme conditions on Northern Siberia, where no other humans ever survived. They had to invent snowshoes, clothing, new weapons and hunting techniques. They couldn’t settle south of Alaska until around 14kya when global warming melted glaciers. By around 12kya, Sapiens had settled the southern tip of Argentina. This is incredibly rapid — moving south, they had to adapt over and over again to different climates."
