#+title: Hypothesis: <Person>/interests > <Person>/outbox
When I have a note on a person,
copying an item to the "outbox" section for them can be very duplicative.
Every time I have a new biology idea, say,
I'll want to send it to Mridul and Chen.
Rather than write it in both each time,
I can just keep a permanent link in their files to "biology",
and then check out my latest thoughts on biology when I write to either.
