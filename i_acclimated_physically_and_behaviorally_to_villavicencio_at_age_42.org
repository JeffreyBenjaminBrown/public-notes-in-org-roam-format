#+title: I acclimated physically (and behaviorally) to Villavicencio at age 42.
* serial
  The first and maybe the second time I was here, I was somewhat useless.
  The heat was opressive, and I got sick a lot.
  This time I have a fan on me most of the time,
  I'm working like normal or more,
  I can exercise,
  and while I got a stomach bug for a few days at the start,
  I've been fine for the four weeks since.
