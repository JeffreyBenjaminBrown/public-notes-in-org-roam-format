#+title: reading and rewriting my notes
* TODO merge: [[id:7b2cd1a3-bac4-4057-90e3-a2698a2fdefb][consult your notes : why and how]]

* Remember that I like rewriting my notes.

   Do I like it when it's productive?
   Do I know when it's productive?
   Do I like reading/organizing a topic when I've been procrastinating the topic? (I think so.)
