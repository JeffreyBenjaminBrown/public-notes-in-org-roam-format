Constraints are, like types, first class objects in the language. You can see this at the REPL:

Main> :t Ord
Prelude.Ord : Type -> Type
So, (Ord a, Show a) is an ordinary pair of Types, with two constraints as the first and second element of the pair.

*** We can also use the symbol := instead of = to, among other things, avoid ambiguities with propositional equality:

** Implementation declarations can themselves have constraints. To help with resolution, the arguments of an implementation must be constructors (either data or type constructors) or variables (i.e. you cannot give an implementation for a function). For example, to define a Show implementation for vectors, we need to know that there is a Show implementation for the element type, because we are going to use it to convert each element to a String:
   Show a => Show (Vect n a) where
       show xs = "[" ++ show' xs ++ "]" where
           show' : forall n . Vect n a -> String
           show' Nil        = ""
           show' (x :: Nil) = show x
           show' (x :: xs)  = show x ++ ", " ++ show' xs
   Note that we need the explicit forall n . in the show' function because otherwise the n is already in scope, and fixed to the value of the top level n.

*** In brief: In types, indexes are values and parameters are types.

    https://idris2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/typesfuns.html
    Vect Nat a "declares a family of types, and so the form of the declaration is rather different from the simple type declarations above. We explicitly state the type of the type constructor Vect — it takes a Nat and a type as an argument, where Type stands for the type of types. We say that Vect is indexed over Nat and parameterised by Type."
** type constructor and data constructor
   Nat and List are type constructors.
   Nil is a data constructor.

** How to identify Nat with ordinary integers?
*** You may wonder, by the way, why we have unary natural numbers when our computers have perfectly good integer arithmetic built in. The reason is primarily that unary numbers have a very convenient structure which is easy to reason about, and easy to relate to other data structures as we will see later. Nevertheless, we do not want this convenience to be at the expense of efficiency. Fortunately, Idris knows about the relationship between Nat (and similarly structured types) and numbers. This means it can optimise the representation, and functions such as plus and mult
** As well as functions, where blocks can include local data declarations
** Partial functions must be granted an explicit exception
   partial fromMaybe : Maybe a -> a
   fromMaybe (Just x) = x
** Interfaces
*** syntax
    interface Show a where
      show : a -> String
*** is hard to imagine many cases where the /= method will be anything other than the negation of the result of applying the == method. It is therefore convenient to give a default definition for each method in the interface declaration, in terms of the other method:

          interface Eq a where
              (==) : a -> a -> Bool
              (/=) : a -> a -> Bool

              x /= y = not (x == y)
              x == y = not (x /= y)
          A minimal complete implementation of Eq requires either == or /= to be defined, but does not require both.

** I don't understand The Finite Sets
   https://idris2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/typesfuns.html#the-finite-sets
*** What they're for.
    Natural numbers have a lower bound and no upper bound.
    Finite sets, based on natural numbers, have both.
*** But what imposes the upper bound?
** Implicit args and naming
*** Implicit arguments, given with the forall declaration, are not given in applications of index; their values can be inferred from the types of the Fin n and Vect n a arguments. Any name beginning with a lower case letter which appears as a parameter or index in a type declaration, which is not applied to any arguments, will always be automatically bound as an implicit argument; this is why data type names cannot begin with a lower case letter. Implicit arguments can still be given explicitly in applications, using {a=value} and {n=value}, for example:

          index {a=Int} {n=2} FZ (2 :: 3 :: Nil)
          In fact, any argument, implicit or explicit, may be given a name. We could have declared the type of index as:

          index : (i : Fin n) -> (xs : Vect n a) -> a
          It is a matter of taste whether you want to do this — sometimes it can help document a function by making the purpose of an argument more clear.

*** In general, functions and data types must be defined before use, since dependent types allow functions to appear as part of types, and type checking can rely on how particular functions are defined (though this is only true of total functions; see Section Totality Checking).

    vec : DPair Nat (\n => Vect n Int)
    vec = MkDPair 2 [3, 4]
*** One use for dependent pairs is to return values of dependent types where the index is not necessarily known in advance.
    For example, if we filter elements out of a Vect according to some predicate, we will not know in advance what the length of the resulting vector will be:
    filter : (a -> Bool) -> Vect n a -> (p ** Vect p a)
** The type checker can fill in values, not just types
*** We can write an underscore _ in place of values which we expect the type checker to fill in, so the above definition could also be written as:

**** { a.b.c := val } x
*** Dots and space
**** map (.a.b.c) xs
     For the dot notation, there must be no spaces after the dots but there may be spaces before the dots. The composite projection must be parenthesised, otherwise map .a.b.c xs would be understood as map.a.b.c xs.
**** Dots with spaces around them stand for function composition operators [reversing the order from the record dot notation]
*** Field names can be reused in multiple records.
*** Dependent records
**** an example
     record SizedClass (size : Nat) where

       students : Vect size Person
       className : String
**** It is possible to use record update syntax to update dependent fields, provided that all related fields are updated at once. For example:
     cons : t -> (x : Nat ** Vect x t) -> (x : Nat ** Vect x t)
     cons val xs
         = { fst := S (fst xs),
             snd := (val :: snd xs) } xs

*** "0 parameters"
**** are unavailable at runtime.
     By default parameters that are not explicitly ascribed a type in an interface declaration are assigned the quantity 0. This means that the parameter is not available to use at runtime in the methods’ definitions.

** "Do notation" is just syntactic sugar for (>>=) and (>>).

*** "Do notation" doesn't even have to be for monads!
 https://idris2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/interfaces.html

 The translation of do notation is entirely syntactic, so there is no need for the (>>=) and (>>) operators to be the operator defined in the Monad interface. Idris will, in general, try to disambiguate which operators you mean by type, but you can explicitly choose with qualified do notation, for example:

 m_add : Maybe Int -> Maybe Int -> Maybe Int
 m_add x y = Prelude.do
                x' <- x -- Extract value from x
                y' <- y -- Extract value from y
                pure (x' + y') -- Add them
 The Prelude.do means that Idris will use the (>>=) and (>>) operators defined in the Prelude.
*** Flatten nested cases in do-notation with pattern match alternatives.

    It can be desirable to have multiple implementations of an interface for the same type, for example to provide alternative methods for sorting or printing values. To achieve this, implementations can be named as follows:

       compare Z (S n)     = GT
       compare (S n) Z     = LT
       compare Z Z         = EQ
       compare (S x) (S y) = compare @{myord} x y
*** using one
    The syntax compare @{myord} gives an explicit implementation to compare, otherwise it would use the default implementation for Nat.

*** PITFALL: [[id:b472f211-6991-4d7a-b842-3dc99971eafb][export rules are per namespace, not per file]]
*** the three kinds
 Idris allows for functions, types, and interfaces to be marked as: private, export, or public export. Their general meaning is as follows:

 private meaning that it is not exported at all. This is the default.

 export meaning that its top level type is exported.

 public export meaning that the entire definition is exported.

**** the confusing quote
     "the type and definition are exported, and the definition can be used after it is imported. In other words, the definition itself is considered part of the module’s interface. The long name public export is intended to make you think twice about doing this."
**** Is this the whole solution?
     If the function needs to be accessed only at runtime, use export. However, if it’s also meant to be used at compile time (e.g. to prove a theorem), use public export.
*** export level interpretations for data types
 export - the type constructor is exported
 public export - the type constructor and data constructors are exported
*** export level interpretations for interfaces
 export - the interface name is exported

 public export - the interface name, method names and default definitions are exported
*** limits on how they refer to each other

    :END:
**** my question
     If this is true, how can private functions ever get used?
**** the quote
     definitions must not refer to anything within a lower level of visibility. For example, public export definitions cannot use private or export names, and export types cannot use private names.
*** re-export an imported module
    import public C
*** create a module which exports a larger API from other sub-modules
 module                          Books

 import public Books.Hardback as Books
 import public Books.Comic    as Books
*** COOL - dividing a module into sub-namespaces
**** This module defines Foo.X.test and Foo.Y.test
 module Foo

 namespace X
   export
   test : Int -> Int
   test x = x * 2

 namespace Y
   export
   test : String -> String
   test x = x ++ x
**** Those two names can be disambiguated by their types.

     so the two test definitions above need the export flag to be visible outside their own namespaces.
** Different modules can define identical names.
*** "If names are otherwise unambiguous, there is no need to give the fully qualified name"
*** "Names can be disambiguated either by giving an explicit qualification, using the with keyword, or according to their type."
*** with-based disambiguation
 The with keyword in expressions comes in two variants:

 with BTree.insert (insert x empty) for one name

 with [BTree.insert, BTree.empty] (insert x empty) for multiple names

 This is particularly useful with do notation, where it can often improve error messages: with MyModule.(>>=) do ...
*** PITFALL: "no formal link between the module name and its filename"
** type synonyms
   Type synonyms in Idris are created by writing a function. When setting the visibility for a module, it is usually a good idea to public export all type synonyms if they are to be used outside the module. Otherwise, Idris won’t know what the synonym is a synonym for.
** "parameterised blocks"
   https://idris2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/modules.html#parameterised-blocks

      f : (1 x : a) -> b
      => if f x is used exactly once, then x is used exactly once.

*** Multiplicities can be made explicit.
    ignoreN : (0 n : Nat) -> Vect n a -> Nat - this function cannot look at n at run time
*** Implicitly bound names are "erased" (i.e. erased at runtime).
