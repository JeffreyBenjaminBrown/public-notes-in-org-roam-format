#+title: if (command history|paste|backspace) misbehaves in `conda python3` in Docker
* a solution
  Invoke the shell with `ipython` instead of `python` at the CL.
* the blame
  It appears to be Conda's fault, not Docker's.
* details on the problems
   Pushing `up` causes ^[[A to print to my screen,
     rather than recalling an earlier command.
   In AWS, pasting into the shell works,
     but causes a lot of garbage characters to appear.
   Someone on StackOverflow who had history recall problems
     had the backspace problem too; I didn't
