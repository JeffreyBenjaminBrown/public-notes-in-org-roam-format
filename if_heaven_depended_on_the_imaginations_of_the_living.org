#+title: if heaven depended on the imaginations of the living
* justification
  Neil Gaiman's novel "American Gods" is kind of this idea.
* More practically
  art in the real world is like this.
* clarification
  The idea being something like,
  when you imagine what the dead would say,
  they live on -- not metaphorically, but consciously.
