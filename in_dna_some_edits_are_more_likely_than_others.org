#+title: In DNA, Some Edits Are More Likely Than Others.
* "Transitions" convert A <-> G or C <-> T.
* Transitions and transversions partition the space of base substitutions.
That is, "transversions" are everything else.
* Transitions are about twice as likely in humans as transversions,
even though there are (exactly) twice as many kinds of transversions.
* Substitutions are 3 times more likely than other edits in humans.
"Other edits" includes insertions and deletions.
The "in-del rate" is about 1/3000.
The "substitution rate" is about 1/1000.
