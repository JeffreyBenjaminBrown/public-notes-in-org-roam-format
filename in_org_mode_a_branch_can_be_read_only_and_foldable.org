#+title: in org-mode, a branch can be read-only and foldable
* elaboration
  That is, the read-only property does not interfere
  with the user's ability to fold/unfold org bullets.
  See skg/src/read-only.el for making text read-only.
* what the metadata org-branch would hold
  Title (as the top bullet).
  Author.
  Maybe other stuff.
