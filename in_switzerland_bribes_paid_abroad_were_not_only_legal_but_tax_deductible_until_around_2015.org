Before 2000: Bribes to both domestic and foreign officials were generally legal and deductible as "business expenses" under Swiss tax law.

2000: Bribery of Swiss public officials was criminalized under the Swiss Penal Code. However, bribes paid to foreign officials were still legal and deductible.

2001: Switzerland ratified the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention, making bribery of foreign public officials technically a criminal offense. But enforcement was minimal, and deductibility for tax purposes continued for a while.

2015: The Swiss parliament passed reforms to finally prohibit the deductibility of bribes to foreign officials. This brought tax law fully in line with criminal law and OECD guidelines.
