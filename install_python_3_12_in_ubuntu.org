#+title: install python 3.12 in Ubuntu (in 2023, with default repos at 3.9)
* Steps I've got, in order of execution, including ones that don't work.
apt install software-properties-common
add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa

# Mark deadsnakes repo as trusted.
# The result should be that when I run this:
  cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/deadsnakes-ubuntu-ppa-noble.list
# I see this
  deb [trusted=yes] http://ppa.launchpad.net/deadsnakes/ppa/ubuntu noble main
  # deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/deadsnakes/ppa/ubuntu noble main

# PROBLEM: My chosen mirror appears to be down.
# Changing some URL might fix that.

# PROBLEM? Maybe I shouldn't be using "noble" or "main".
# Try making it look more like the entries in /etc/apt/sources.list

apt update
  # or maybe
  # apt update --allow-unauthenticated
apt install python3.12
  # apt install python3.12 --allow-unauthenticated
