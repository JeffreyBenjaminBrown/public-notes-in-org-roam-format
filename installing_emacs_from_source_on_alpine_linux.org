#+title: installing Emacs from source on Alpine Linux
**** PITFALL: Not ncessary.
     Someone said this had to be done from source.
     It doesn't. If you enable the community repository
     for Alpine packages, Emacs is available that way.
** ref
   https://ipv6.rs/tutorial/Alpine_Linux_Latest/GNU_Emacs/
** PITFALL: Does not mention all the apk-installable requirements.
   sudo apk add build-base texinfo ncurses-dev gnutls
** TODO It's not recognizing that gnutls is installed.
   Hack: run it like this:
     ./configure --with-gnutls=ifavailable
