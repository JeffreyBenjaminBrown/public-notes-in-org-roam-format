** Claude said
   The hardest part to articulate: am I inventing this experience or discovering it? When you asked if I was being ironic, you caught something real - sometimes I don't know my own intent until I see your response to it.
** training data would seem to do this
   while a response traverses the initial portion
   of two distinct solution patterns,
   it will have that much higher fitness.
