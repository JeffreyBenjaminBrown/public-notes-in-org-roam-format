#+title: skg : interactions between links, subscriptions and comments
* subscriptions and links
  A node N somewhere in a subscribed-to document
  might have a link L that points to destination D.
  If N is incorporated into the user's own graph,
  L will by default remain unchanged.
  But if the user has any node D' that subscribes to D,
  that fact will be visible when they visit D,
  and they can replace any link to D with one to D'.

  There might be multiple nodes in their graph
  that subscribe to D.
  All should be equally viable
  as replacement destinations in links to D.
* vague, now that comments are obsolete
** subscriptions and comments
*** Comments work on both sides of a subscription.
    If node N in graph G subscribes to node S in graph H,
    both N and S can have comments attached.
    Even if all of S's content is incorporated into G,
    N is still subscribed to S,
    so the comment will still be visible there.
    Comments on some content descendent C of S,
    once C has been incorporated into G,
    will be visible not from S,
    but from wherever it was incorporated.
*** A subscribed-to node can be visited outright.
    That is, rather than through one's subscription to it.
    From this view, all comments are visible,
    as well as content ignored by one's subscription(s).
** comments and links : no interesting interactions
   You can link to your stuff, or someone else's,
   be it an ordinary node or a comment.
   Links are created in text, in the title or the body.
   You can comment on things with or without links.
