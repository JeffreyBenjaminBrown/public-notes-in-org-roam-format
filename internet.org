* subdomain: definition
** www.example.com is a subdomain of example.com
* use `expose` to get a public URL for something on localhost

  "you can get a public URL for a Node application being served from localhost or 127.0.0.1 on your local machine, even if its behind a firewall or corporate network? It doesnâ€™t require any networking config and you can do it in a single command with expose, for example expose 80 as myapi.expose.sh."
