#+title: Intimacy is permissions.
* It's qualitative, not quantitative.
  Some people have permission to make fun of you.
  Some people have permission to read your private
  (half-baked, not obviously useful) thoughts.
* Permission to know things.
** Would be as deep for us as it would be for the gods.
** Permission to know feelings you hide from others.
