* justifications for it
** non-monomania | experience as motivation
   One maximizes no single objective function.
   And some acts are for the experience, not the outcome.
** context sensitivity
   All of what you do depends on what you are aware of, and some acts might contradict others taken while aware of other things.

*** Whether a future would be good.
*** Whether a method is feasible.
    inc. pyschological feasibility --
    i.e. that it will be pursued with enough vigor
** What sets of (inconsistent, interacting) strategies could oscillating beliefs generate?
