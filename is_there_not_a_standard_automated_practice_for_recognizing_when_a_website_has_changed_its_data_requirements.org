#+title: Is there not a standard automated practice for recognizing when a website has changed its data requirements?
* ChatGPT offers some good ideas
  Versioning: Many APIs use versioning to manage changes. If the API you're consuming implements versioning, you can continue to use the older version while adapting to the new one.

  Automated Testing: Implementing automated tests, including integration tests that check for API responses, can help catch issues when the API changes. Continuous integration (CI) practices can ensure that tests run regularly.

  Monitoring and Alerts: Use monitoring tools to track API responses and performance. Setting up alerts for unexpected changes in response structures or status codes can help you react before users encounter issues.

  Schema Validation: Tools like JSON Schema or OpenAPI Specification (formerly Swagger) can be used to define the expected structure of API responses. Validating responses against these schemas can catch discrepancies early.

  Documentation and Change Logs: Regularly review the documentation and change logs of the API provider. Many services announce breaking changes, deprecated features, or updates, allowing you to prepare for necessary adjustments.

  API Gateway: Implementing an API gateway can help manage requests to external services and handle changes in a more controlled manner. It can also allow you to abstract away changes in the underlying API.

  Fallback Mechanisms: Consider implementing fallback mechanisms or error handling strategies that can provide alternative responses when encountering errors due to API changes.

  Collaboration: If possible, establish a communication channel with the API provider. Some services offer support or partnership programs that can give you advance notice of upcoming changes.
