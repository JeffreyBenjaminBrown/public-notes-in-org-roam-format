** the Haskell JACK library on my computer
   /home/jeff/code/haskell/libs,tools/jack
** pkg-config seems not to recognize my JACK
   jeff@jbb-hp17:jack$ jackd --version
   jackdmp version 1.9.19 tmpdir /dev/shm protocol 9

   jeff@jbb-hp17:jack$ cabal repl
   Build profile: -w ghc-9.0.2 -O1
   In order, the following will be built (use -v for more details):
    - jack-0.7.2 (lib) (first run)
   Configuring library for jack-0.7.2..
   cabal: The pkg-config package 'jack' version >=0.118 && <1 || >=1.9.8 && <2 is
   required but it could not be found.
* questions
** How to get the name of the JACK server?
   needed by Sound.JACK.newClient
* keeping JACK happy
** Killing SC before the GHCI process makes Jack err.
** don't leave Spotify open (even if not playing) when turning Qjackctl
   not sure but maybe bad
* leaving Qjackctl on seems to work
  I left it open, not running, for days and I can play the synth with it today.
