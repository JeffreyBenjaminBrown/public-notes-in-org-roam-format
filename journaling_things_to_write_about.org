* things to write about
From the series on journaling for [personal change?]
in the Waking Up app.
** my state relative to each of the people I care about
** My secrets
*** Describe what I perceive, and how I perceive it
**** How do feelings interact with those perceptions?
**** Where does my attention go, or avoid?
     [[id:2741003a-955b-4d4e-a7d1-152e7cbdd8db][Wants pull at attention, which we sometimes fight.]]
*** How does it benefit me or others, or fail to do so?
*** What would people be most surprised to learn
*** Implications for what I want
*** What they suggest about how I feel about the people I hide them from
*** What are they
** Try describing me to a hypothetical stranger I don't care about impressing.
*** Then consider how what I've left out suggests blind spots, and how they might affect me.
*** Only 4 or 5 sentences.
*** [[id:3e3f7daa-1c86-4cb4-9010-59cd6e8080a4][<2025-02-26 Wed>: trying it]]
** How I have been perceived
** Roles I play
** Describe all your {loved ones, lovers, friends, ..}.
   Try to write about them all in the same day, or at least read about them that way, to see the forest for the trees.
