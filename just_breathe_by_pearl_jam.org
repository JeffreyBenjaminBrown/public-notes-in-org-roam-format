#+title: Just Breathe, by Pearl Jam
* selected parts
** verse
 Yes, I understand / That every life must end   [0, 7]
 As we sit alone / I know someday we must go
 Oh, I'm a lucky man / to count on both hands
   The ones I love
 Some folks just have one / Yeah others they got none
** bridge
 Stay with me, Let's just breathe [9, 5]
** chorus
 Did I say that I need you? [7, 2]
 Did I say that I want you?
 Oh, if I didn't, I'm a fool [5, 9]
 No one knows this more than me [2m, 0\5, 11\7]
 As I come clean
** verse 2
 I wonder every day
 As I look upon your face
 Everything you gave
 And nothing you would take
** bridge 2
 Stay with me, oh lord I see [9, 5]
