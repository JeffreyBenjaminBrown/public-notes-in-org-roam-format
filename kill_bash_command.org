#+title: kill (bash command)
* kill all processes matching a regex (here "emacs")
** alternatives
*** use `awk` to extract each PID, then `xargs` each into `kill`
    ps -ef | grep -i emacs | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill
*** use `awk` to stick `kill` in front of each PID, then send to `sh`
    ps -ef | grep "emacs" | awk '{print "kill " $2}' | sh
* pkill -f : for when a process won't be killed by name
  [[id:b77f584e-12c1-45dc-a2a8-4ec2c1eb1e6a][Firefox, for instance, is like this.]]
  In that case use `pkill`.
    pkill -f firefox
