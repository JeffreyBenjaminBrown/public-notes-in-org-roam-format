#+title: Knowing how self and other feel can both be hard.
  Feelings change. One can be attracted to another until learning more about them. Having stated they are attracted, they will later look like they are lying.
  Sometimes people consciously lie about how they feel -- in particular, that they are interested in a longer-term partnership. When they do, they can generally plausibly deny having lied. Worse, this dynamic can (subconsciously, evolutionaryily) motivate not understanding one's own feelings well.
