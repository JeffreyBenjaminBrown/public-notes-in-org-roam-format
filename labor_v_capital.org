#+title: labor v. capital
* Labor has to unionize against capital, because capital is locally oligopolistic.
  yet it sells to [a global audience in perfect competition, that can't bargain]
** Therefore artist labels should prevent entry, so they can compete with the few distributors.
* Spotify is like an artists' charity that makes a ton of money.
* Distributors should not just reward creators with a big fraction, but should also (if I'm right about creators' preferences) make the pay structure more progressive.
  I assume the artists' ex-ante preferences are more important than what they feel after their reward for distribution has been determined.
* Artists vs. distributors who own infrastructure.
