= Facebook group moderated by Ron Sword
* Arguing online is not just wasteful, but dangerous.

   guru: "Arguing is never worth it."
   pupil: "I disagree."
   guru: "You are right".
* Remember your purpose in a group.
  It would help to remember my purpose in the group. If it is to debate, great. If it is to extract information about microtonal guitaristry, though, then advancing some other point that someone else disagrees with does not advance my own interests.
* Social injuries can be invisible to the injured.
* Social injuries online can be invisible to the aggressor.
* Some people will react in surprisingly negative ways to what I view as ordinary or even interesting discussion.
* Know who has power. Find who they are.
** Recognize that the mods of groups have power.
