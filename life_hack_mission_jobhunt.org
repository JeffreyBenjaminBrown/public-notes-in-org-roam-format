#+title: life hack ? mission => jobhunt
* the idea
Unless I'm looking for jobs I care about,
I won't engage in the jobhunt.
So don't even try to look for other kinds.
* hasn't worked so far for me
  No matter how strongly I feel about any cause -- and I do --
  nothing seems to motivate me to look for jobs when I've got one.
