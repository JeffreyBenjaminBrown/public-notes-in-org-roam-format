#+title: link content filters \ skg
* example motivation
  [[id:33d5cd4e-8a0c-48f0-85c2-467db86e1862][the ternary shows-because relationship]]
* the filter
  I want a container A with a link to B to have an optional filter onto B's content, such that what passes the filter shows as B's content.
* The ternary nature of the relationship can somewhat be forgotten
  by the reader, or borne sub- or at least less consciously.
** elaboration
   One could simply talk about the link source showing some of the link content.
   This only becomes a ternary relationship when we consider that the link
   is only meaningful in relation to its context A.
   That ternary nature *does* need explicit representation in TypeDB
   if the user wants the filter to depend on which of multiple containers
   the link appears in. That's a violation of the expected use.
   It's also unnecessary. Multiple nodes whose content is that link
   can instead be made, and I think they probably should.
   If viewing their distinct content at once is desired,
   it's easy to collect all links with the same target in one view.
