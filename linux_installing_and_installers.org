#+title: Linux: distributions, desktop environments, window managers
* PITFALL: Distro > Desktop Environment > Window Manager
* Linux distros
** Tiny Core might be the smallest.
   It's hard to use but it's the fastest, running entirely in RAM.
   Not part of NixOS.
** Puppy Linux is so small it can be run off a USB stick.
** other extremely lightweight distros
   Linux Lite -- not on NixOS
   antiX
* Linux desktop environments
** [[id:894db12b-c5a2-434a-8680-49f2ad9872bf][KDE]] is the cadillac.
   But it's not text-configurable,
   and the Settings GUI takes me about an hour of work each time I install.
** Gnome is text-configurable.
** lxqt seems to be the lightest mainstream desktop environment.
   services.xserver.desktopManager.lxqt.enable
** [[id:dd8238af-6bce-4242-ab4d-b531190092f4][Xfce]] and Mate are the second-lightest mainstream desktop environments.
   They're about equally lightweight.
*** xfce is part of Xubuntu and other distros.
* Linux window managers
** [[id:c26ed276-a4a0-4b0a-8b4b-6a47b47fb85a][xmonad (window manager)]]
* [[id:448597aa-1570-45b7-8c16-8c5e132f43a6][using xmonad and xfce in NixOS]]
