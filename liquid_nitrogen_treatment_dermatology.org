#+title: liquid nitrogen treatment (dermatology)
The doctor sprays liquid nitrogen in short bursts for six seconds on an area of the skin.
It should form a blister, then scab, then peel off in a few days.
The idea in the case of keratosis treatment is to rid the skin of the cells with errant (usually sun-damaged) DNA.
