#+title: list comprehensions to bind a variable number of variables \ Haskell
* my question on SO
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74758188/i-would-use-a-list-comprehension-but-the-number-of-variables-to-bind-is-unknown
* simple answer
  https://stackoverflow.com/a/74758782/916142
* more complicated response,
  which can be golfed down to a fold
  rather than explicit recursion.
