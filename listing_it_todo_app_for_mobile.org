* TODO ? [[id:b7c89ebb-2ff1-40a9-867e-48594ecd06c1][org-to-listing-it can't handle non-bullets]]
* how to convert org notes to Listing It notes
** PITFALL : [[id:b7c89ebb-2ff1-40a9-867e-48594ecd06c1][org-to-listing-it can't handle non-bullets]]
** format the org file under a single top heading
   Otherwise the result will be to import a forest, not a tree.
** run `~/bash/org-to-listing-it.sh` on the org file
** Download that file onto my phone.
   Google Drive works best for this.
** From the Files app, choose "Open With" and select Listing It.
