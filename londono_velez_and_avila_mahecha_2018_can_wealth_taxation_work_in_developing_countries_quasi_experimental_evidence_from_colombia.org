#+title: Londoño-Vélez And Ávila-Mahecha 2018: "Can Wealth Taxation Work In Developing Countries? Quasi-Experimental Evidence From Colombia"
* some terms
** tax avoidance is legal
** tax evasion is illegal
* How did they get this data?
"Our panel data covers
all income and wealth tax filers between 1993 and 2016, that is, over 20.5 million observations
(taxpayer-years)."
* Colombian data is unique
** wealth data is available even when not taxed
"Colombian
taxpayers annually report their taxable and non-taxable wealth in their income tax statements."
** 5 wealth tax reforms from 2002 to the writing of the paper
** tax notches
because average rather than marginal rates are specified and they vary across wealth brackets.
** they observe reported wealth before and after a notch comes into play
** bunching to duck the tax notches reflects sheltering
"bunching in the distribution of reported wealth predominantly reflects sheltering. It is
difficult for individuals to immediately bunch below the notch points using real responses (e.g.,
investment) because wealth partly depends on asset prices"
* main results
** ducking the notches
"the marginal buncher would have reported 21 percent more wealth in the ab-
sence of the wealth tax notch."
** elasticiy of wealth wr/t (1-tax rate)
"Our estimated elasticity suggests that a one percent increase in (one
minus) the wealth tax rate raises reported wealth by 2 percent."
** lost revenue
"Applying this elasticity through-
out the wealth distribution implies bunching responses generate revenue losses of up to one-fifth
of the mechanically projected revenue."
** offshoring
*** is triggered by wealth taxes
"the reintroduction of annual wealth taxes in Colombia coincides with a period
marked by a tenfold increase in Colombian offshore entities."
*** immediately reduces reported wealth
We find taxpayers reduce the assets they report to the tax authority by 10.9
percent immediately after incorporating an offshore entity.
* some history
** The Colombian disclosure program.
Around 2016, for a few years, you could disclose previously unreported assets and not be fined back-taxes.
** in December 2016, Colombia criminalized tax evasion for the first time.
** Halfway through the disclosure program, the Panama Papers leak happened.
This increased the perceived risk to tax evaders.
* Colombian innstitutions are unique
** There is a *presumptive* income tax based on wealth.
