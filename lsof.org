#+title: lsof (software)
* says what proceses are using which devices
* use lsof to see what (e.g. pulseaudio, alsamixer) is using sound devices
sudo lsof /dev/snd/*
Helpful, e.g., when QJackCtl says it can't use hw:0 because something else is.
(Killing the other process worked for me, at least when it was alsamixer --
and then I could even start alsamixer back up.)
