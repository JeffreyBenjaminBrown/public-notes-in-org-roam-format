** where I found that
   It's currently the cover image in the official Lumatone User Group on Facebook
** some dimensions in it
   The longest row is 602 pixels.
   The whole keyboard is 811 pixels long.

** a rough computation
   The image I see in the PDF of the manual,
   appropriately scaled on my screen,
   is 11.75" across. In reality it's 92 cm across.
   The longest "horizontal" row of buttons is 8.75 inches across,
   and has 28 buttons.

   Therefore the longest row of buttons is
   92 * (8.75 / 11.75) = 68.5 cm across,
   so each button is
   68.5 / 28 = 2.45 cm across.

   For the 6\41 x 1\41 layout,
   ano octave is just under 8 columns across, or
   8 * 2.45 = 19.6 cm,
   just a little inside what I can comfortably reach.

   Monome buttons are about 1.44 cm across,
   so the Lumatone is 2.45 / 1.44 = 1.7 times as big,
   kind of. The hexagons make it weird.

   On the piano, 28 keys spans 66 cm,
   so the Lumatone keys are 3% wider (on-axis)
   than piano keys.
** a pretty exact computation
   The Lumatone in reality is 92 cm across.
   The longest row of buttons, based on the color picture,
   is 602 / 811 the length of the full keyboard, i.e.
     ( (602 / 811) * 92 = 68.3 ) cm

   (That implies each key is 68.3 / 28 = 2.44 cm across.)

   In the black and white image of the keys only,
   the longest row is 1335 / 1599 the length of the full image,
   so measured across, the full image should be
     ((1599 / 1335) * 68.3 = 81.8) cm
