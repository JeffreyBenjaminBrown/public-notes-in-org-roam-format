   The longest row is 602 pixels.
   The whole keyboard is 811 pixels long.

* key dimensions
** a video that gives a sense of geometric scale

** a rough computation
   The image I see in the PDF of the manual,
   appropriately scaled on my screen,
   is 11.75" across. In reality it's 92 cm across.
   The longest "horizontal" row of buttons is 8.75 inches across,
   and has 28 buttons.

   Therefore the longest row of buttons is
   92 * (8.75 / 11.75) = 68.5 cm across,
   so each button is
   68.5 / 28 = 2.45 cm across.

   For the 6\41 x 1\41 layout,
   ano octave is just under 8 columns across, or
   8 * 2.45 = 19.6 cm,
   just a little inside what I can comfortably reach.

   Monome buttons are about 1.44 cm across,
   so the Lumatone is 2.45 / 1.44 = 1.7 times as big,
   kind of. The hexagons make it weird.

   On the piano, 28 keys spans 66 cm,
   so the Lumatone keys are 3% wider (on-axis)
   than piano keys.
** a pretty exact computation
   The Lumatone in reality is 92 cm across.
   The longest row of buttons, based on the color picture,
   is 602 / 811 the length of the full keyboard, i.e.
     ( (602 / 811) * 92 = 68.3 ) cm

   (That implies each key is 68.3 / 28 = 2.44 cm across.)

   In the black and white image of the keys only,
   the longest row is 1335 / 1599 the length of the full image,
   so measured across, the full image should be
     ((1599 / 1335) * 68.3 = 81.8) cm
*** based on these images

* my reach
  A function (Haskell)
  to get the length of a, given SAS and A = 2 pi / 3:
    a b c = sqrt ( b**2 + c**2 - 2 * b * c * cos (2 * pi / 3) )
  Multiply that by 2.44 to get the length in cm.

  In brief, my reach per column is:
    5: past -6 to 4
    6: past -6 to 3
    7: past -6 to 2
    8: past -6 to 0
    9: from -7 to -2

  If the angle between (5,0) and (5,2) is 120 degrees,
  then I can reach down on the fourth column to (4,5),
  up on the fifth column beyond (5,-6),
  down on the fifth column to (5,4),
  up on the sixth column past (6,-6)
  down on the sixth column to (6,3)
    so I can't quite reach the just major 10th (6,4) in 41-edo,
  past (7,-6),
    so I can easily reach the just minor third (7,-1) in 41-edo,
  to (7,2),
  past (8,-6),
   to (8,0),
  from (9,-7)
    so I can reach the just major 10th from the other side (9,-3)
  to (9,-2)
