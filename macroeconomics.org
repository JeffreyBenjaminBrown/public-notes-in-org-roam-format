* The special international status of the US dollar is not important to the US.

** maybe the biggest benefit
   The dollars held outside the US do represent a 0-interest loan, which in times of high interest rates can be meaningful -- about 0.25% of GDP.
** some non-existent benefits
*** The US current account deficit is less than Britain's or Australia's.
*** The US borrows at a higher interest rate than Britain or Japan.
*** The British pound, which was only overtaken by the US dollar in 1955 and not special at all by 1975, has only increased in value against the dollar since.
* Countries might not give the widest coverage as units of news analysis.
  There's something repetitive about reading "this country's got a tyrant ... and this other country's got a tyrant ... and here's what the tyrant over there's doing ..."
