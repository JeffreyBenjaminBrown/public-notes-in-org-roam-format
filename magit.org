** PITFALL: This seems to need to be done from the *options* menu.
   That's the thing that comes up in Magit
   when I press "S-d" (capital d).
   And once in, saving the changes might just require "x-s",
   not "C-x C-s" as documented below.
** read the pitfall, then these
*** C-x s (transient-set)
    This command saves the value of the active transient for this Emacs session.
*** C-x C-s (transient-save)
    Save the value of the active transient persistently across Emacs sessions.
