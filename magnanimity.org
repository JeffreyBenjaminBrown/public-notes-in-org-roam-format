#+title: magnanimity
* A strange, ancient idea, a mix of belligerence, pride and healthy qualities.
* Aristotle on it
** "haughty towards men of position and fortune, but courteous towards those of moderate station"
** "open both in love and in hate"
** "not bear a grudge"
   Don't punch up for the sake of punching,
   just as it's warranted.
** Too much of it is vanity, but too little is also bad.
