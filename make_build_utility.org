#+title: make (build utility)
* PITFALLs
** make ignores symlinks!
   It will treat a target as unbuilt, and thus try to build it,
   if it is a symlink.
* `makefile --trace` explains why it wants to rebuild something
  Kind of useless, though -- it only restates the dependency section of the target it wants to rebuild.
  A natural companion to --dry-run.
* draw graph of Makefile dependencies
