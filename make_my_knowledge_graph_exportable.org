#+title: Make my knowledge graph exportable.
* plan
** create an export ".md" version of each file,
   substituting filepaths for the IDs.
** To link to property drawers internal to a file,
   I will need [[id:92ad6660-1efc-4ba8-b1d1-edddc2b54455][anchors in Markdown]].
* TODO experiment with markdown and headings
  Before thinking about org stuff,
  try linking to a heading in a file from within that file,
  or within another file.
  What if two headings share the same text?
* once my notes are linkable online
  tell Nicole
