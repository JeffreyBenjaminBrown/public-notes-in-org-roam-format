#+title: make org-mode indentation changes less noisy
* goal
Can Emacs be configured such that if I change the indentation of headlines, and any of a headline's text body text was aligned to start before the first character (excluding the asterisks and whitespace thereafter) of the headline, then that headline's body text will not change its indentation?
