#+title: making a microtonal guitar
* TODO tell Dave Keenan saddle clearance
  "above the plane of the fretboard"
  which probably requires three measurements --
  at nut, at 12th fret, at bridge.
* TODO maybe add more frets near nut
  Don't forget to make it 34-edo near the nut,
  for an odd number of frets
  (11 would be appealingly symmetric, given the tuning)
  so that the octave fret is present.
