#+title: big programs in Emacs, managing
* would be good to read the entire Emacs Lisp manual
  https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/elisp.html
* the Emacs manual section on managing big programs
  https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/emacs.html#Maintaining
* handy project-aware commands
** "current project" can be defined by the Git folder structure
   or else by EDE, which who cares what that is.
   It ignores .gitignored files
** C-x p g : match a regexp in all files of this project
** C-x p r : query-replace a regexp in all files of this project
** C-x p d : dired to the project's root
