** Mary
   Queen of Scotland.
   Widow of a (prince?) of France.
   Married the (earl? duke?) Henry,
   after Elizabeth asked her to marry an Englishman,
   which Mary then regretted.
** Elizabeth (Isabella in Spanish)
   Queen of England.
   Had "the pox", face scarred.
   Asked her closest advisor to (upon his suggestion) wage civil war in Scotland and that she know nothing about it.
   Too afraid to marry, which makes Mary's son the likely heir.
** Henry
   Earl or duke of something in England.
   Marries Mary.
** Some angry Scottish advisor
   Disrespected Elizabeth twice in public.
   At last sight, furious that she angered her sister,
   thinking she risks war.
   Resigns from her council.
** The English ambassador
   is black.
   Revealed in a tryst with one of Mary's (helper girls?)
   that Elizabeth was sick.
