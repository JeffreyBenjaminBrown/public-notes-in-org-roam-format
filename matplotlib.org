* BUG: Non-unique labels causes data truncation
  This might arise in other contexts.
  At the least, when drawing bar charts,
  a label set (for the x-axis) like ["a","b","c","a","b","c"]
  will cause the bar chart to have only three bars, not six,
  even if every other input vector is likewise length six.
