#+title: Matthew Auttrey on fretting a guitar
* the tools he uses
  a good fret saw that matches your fret tang, a fret hammer, end nippers for cutting frets the length, a good flat battery file for leveling, a z file to recrown after leveling, a very small file with a safe edge to round the fret ends. 220,320,400 grits, then 0000 steel wool to polish, masking tape to protect the fingerboard.
* filing
  The big bastard file is laid on frets, parallel to the string direction and run up or down the length of the neck.

  I mark the crowns of all of the frets with a sharpie before filing, then file until every fret has been touched by the file.
