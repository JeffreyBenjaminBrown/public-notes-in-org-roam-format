#+title: inner peace => calm purpose
* elaboration
  Peace clarifies the mind -- perception, self-awareness
  -- thus making prioritization easier.
  Stated negatively, to lack inner peace is dysfunctional.
* It's intuitive and immediate, not deliberative.
* personal
When I had to do something hard (divorce), it helped a lot. I had to be sure I wanted to, and calming the mind made it obvious.
