#+title: merging graph nodes
* see also
** [[id:18047d85-01cc-4323-bcc0-27c24524dc98][graph merges, e.g. merges of whole repos of nodes]]
* PITFALL: add_missing_info_to_trees replaces IDs with PIDs
* Merges should be recorded via extra_id.
* the idea
The result has all the content of both nodes,
and both IDs.
Links to either node now go to the merged node.
Merging is flat and simple -- reordering content,
or merging content within the merged notes
(potentially at different levels)
can only be done manually.
* Both nodes must be locally owned.
