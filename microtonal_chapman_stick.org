Hello!

I'm going to do radical surgery to my Stick, a basic Grand that I bought in maybe 2003. I want to refret it for the Kite tuning, which uses 20.5 instead of 12 frets per octave, and tunes the strings such that each string has half of the notes available in 41 tone equal temperament.

I realize this probably voids any warranty I might have had. I'm not worried about that.

I'm writing to find out what the usual Stick string gauges are. The Kite tuning puts major thirds, rather than fourths or fifths, between every pair of adjacent strings, so I can't use a standard set of Stick strings. I'll have to do some math to figure out what gauges are appropriate.

I found this list of gauges online:

treble: 8  9  12 18 26 38
bass:   12 18 22 40 65 95


Also I realize that your string gauges have changed somewhat over the years -- at least, you used to offer only one tension, then you started offering heavier strings too. If the above list is out of date, please let me know what would sound better (for a Stick tuned in the recommended matched-reciprocal way).

I hope you're well. I haven't visited in years but I remember you guys being really cool.

Thank you!
Jeff

    I included two options for the bass strings, one 1\41 above the other. Should maybe do the same for the treble strings -- tuning the D a little flatter seems good, since it always sounded a bit strained to me.

    lows = f up_low_c 13

*** explanation, sent to John Starrett
I think Kite is right -- it makes more sense to use the wide spacing in the bass strings and the narrow one in the treble strings. So here's my new tuning scheme:

    string  1, 293.3 Hz,  2 cents flat	of D
    string  2, 243.5 Hz, 24 cents flat	of B
    string  3, 202.2 Hz, 46 cents flat	of G#
    string  4, 167.9 Hz, 32 cents sharp of E
    string  5, 139.4 Hz, 10 cents sharp of C#
    string  6, 115.7 Hz, 13 cents flat	of A#

    string  7, 66.2  Hz, 21 cents sharp of C
    string  8, 82.5  Hz, 2  cents sharp of E
    string  9, 102.8 Hz, 17 cents flat  of G#
    string 10, 128.1 Hz, 36 cents flat  of C
    string 11, 159.6 Hz, 44 cents sharp of Eb
    string 12, 198.8 Hz, 25 cents sharp of G

These assume concert pitch A=440. Due to the quantization of string gauges, I don't know whether it will work better to tune that low C on string 7 a little sharp or a little flat. If tuning it sharp turns out to be bad for some reason, here's an alternate tuning for the bass strings:

    string  7, 65.1  Hz,  8 cents flat	of C
    string  8, 81.1  Hz, 28 cents flat	of E
    string  9, 101.1 Hz, 46 cents flat	of G#
    string 10, 125.9 Hz, 34 cents sharp of B
    string 11, 156.9 Hz, 15 cents sharp of D#
    string 12, 195.4 Hz,  5 cents flat	of G

The high D on string 1 is almost exactly what it would be in a standard 12-edo Stick tuning, so I haven't provided an alternate tuning for those strings. If you think it sounds or plays better at a lower pitch, please let me know and I'll compute an alternate tuning for those treble strings too.

If I recall correctly I got the impression that tuning string 1 to a high D was too ambitious, and the treble strings would have sounded fuller if it was pitched lower. I'm open to the idea of tuning string 1 at C or B instead of D, and adjusting everything else accordingly.
** bass tuned in m3s, treble in M3s
*** lowest bass still C (so .095), highest treble still D (so 8)
*** explanation, sent to John Starrett
    I settled on a tuning. This puts all the strings on the treble side 13\41 apart (a major third), and all strings on the bass side 11\41 apart (a minor third). I've included precise Hz values, and also the nearest 12-tone pitch values. The 12-tone values could of course be off by as much as 50 cents. If you'd like precise 12-tone values (e.g. "E# plus 40 cents") please me know.

     I'm using "string 1" to mean the string that would be farthest from a player's face if they held the Stick like a right-handed guitar, and "string 12" to to mean the one closest to their face. The "treble side" includes strings 1-6, and the "bass side" 7-12. The two heaviest strings are, per Stick tradition, in the center of the instrument.

     1 : 293.3 Hz, D
     2 : 235.4 Hz, A#
     3 : 188.9 Hz, F#
     4 : 151.7 Hz, D#
     5 : 121.7 Hz, B
     6 : 97.7  Hz, G
     7 : 65.1  Hz, C
     8 : 78.4  Hz, Eb
     9 : 94.5  Hz, Gb
     10: 113.8 Hz, Bb
     11: 137   Hz, Db
     12: 165   Hz, E

     The highest note, the D on string 1, is a whole step below a guitar's usual high E. Stick Enterprise's default gauge for that string was .008 for decades. (Today they offer multiple choices, and I don't know what the other options are.)

     The lowest note, the C at string 7, is a third below a bass guitar's usual low E. Stick Enterprise's traditional gauge for that string is 0.095.

     If I recall correctly, they believe lighter gauge at high tension are the best way to avoid fret buzz. As a result the instrument has a weak, nasal tone, at least in some registers. I'll defer to your judgment on the matter. If you have to go through a few string sets to find the right ones, I will of course cover materials and labor for all your experiments.
*** code
    highs = f high_d (-13)
    lows = f mid_e (-11)
** 20.5 edo, 11\41 between strings
*** range
   Puts 55\41 (an octave and a down maj 3rd) across six strings.
   Normal Stick range across open strings is (41*3 + 7 = 130)\41. Doing this instead, since 55*2 = 110 < 130, the open strings would not overlap; there would be a gap of 20\41 (the flatter tritone) betwteen the highest bass and the lowest treble string.

**** Of the hardest intervals, only the octave is especially important.
     The octave is (3,4).
     The neutral 3rd is (0,5) or (2,-5).
     19%16 and 23%16 also lie on fret 5.
**** In the 31-limit without 13 or 23, the range is 4 frets.
     That's for *every* interval, not just the prime ones --
     e.g. including 6/5, 11/5, etc.
     (No range in any limit is less than 4 frets,
     as that's the width of the octave.)
** standard Stick range
   Normally a Chapman Stick has a range of 3 octaves and a whole tone across the open strings, with lots of overlap.

  This is cobbled together -- I found the numbers on a Google image search, and Brian told me which strings are wound.
  It seems kind of absurd -- if the treble strings are 5\12 apart and the bass 7\12, why are 12 and 18 neighbors in both systems?
