* TODO logarithmic isomorphic fret markings
** the question
   What isomorphic fret marking pattern makes it easy to identify intervals of 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. frets, without being hard to see? (Another base would be fine too.)
** an idea
   Let "red" and "blue" = two colors that contrast maximally with the neck.
   Blue, none, white, none, red, none, white, none: 8 frets, any gap easy to see.
   Next 8 are the same, but each piece of tape is colored black in the middle. This should make it easy to see any gap of up to 16 frets.
   Then back to normal. (For factors of 2 beyond 16 I can just eyeball it.)

I read about replacing necks on guitars. It often requires reducing the size of the joint on the neck so it fits in the socket on the guitar. I don't have equipment for that, and I don't know any competent luthiers around here.

Are there brands of guitars that reliably use "standard" sockets for the neck? Are replacement necks from Metatonal Music that size?

If I buy a replacement neck from Metatonal Music, is there a

** zipties
*** advice from others
   Use needlenose pliers to crimp the tie at the corners where it bends around the fretboard.
   Use them also to tighten.
   Trimming the fret-like portion of the ziptie on the bridge side with scissors can help. (Don't trim the side that you fret because that would change the intonation.)

    Score the back of the neck?
    Put grip liner under them?

** with a razor, score around where the fret joins the fretboard

** clean the fret slots once the frets are out
