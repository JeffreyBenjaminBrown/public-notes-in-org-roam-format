#+title: MIDI controls I would like
* [[id:fe42e9f1-0611-445b-8891-d3a7d603b921][MIDI via JACK in Python]]
* Two sustain pedals: Add and clear.
  When `add` is held down, new notes are added.
  When `clear` is pressed, all held notes are released.
* octave shift buttons
** maybe separately for the two halves of the Lumatone
   But if so, do I want to be able to move the border between them?
   Also I'll have to choose (and learn( which octave the border falls in.
* BLOCKED (hard) : Note off is not sent if a key of the same pitch is being held.
  For this I would need the keys to be distinguishable,
  which means each must send a unique MIDI message.
