#+title: mistakes and lies in romance
* Feelings change.
  One can be attracted to another until learning more about them. Having stated they are attracted, they might after the learning be judged liars.
* lying about feelings
  Sometimes people consciously lie about how they feel -- in particular, that they are interested in a longer-term partnership. When they do, they can generally plausibly deny having lied. Worse, this dynamic can (subconsciously, evolutionaryily) motivate ignorance of one's own feelings, such that there is no lie in the liar's mind, just a statement about how they {believe, guess} they feel.
