#+title: mistakes and lies in romance
* Feelings change.
  One can be attracted to another until learning more about them. Having stated they are attracted, they might after the learning be judged liars.
* lying about feelings
  Sometimes people consciously lie about how they feel -- in particular, that they are interested in a longer-term partnership. When they do, they can generally plausibly deny having lied. Worse, this dynamic can (subconsciously, evolutionaryily) motivate ignorance of one's own feelings.
