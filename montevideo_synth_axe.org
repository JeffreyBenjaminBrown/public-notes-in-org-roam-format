* TODO The small monome needs a 90 degree rotation for SimpleVal.
** more info
   For Val it needs no rotation,
   but the 90 degree rotation is much more natural
   (if it's vertically aligned with the cable on top,
   which is how I like it).
** TODO document it
** TODO make it easy to rotate the 128
   since it forgot its rotation at least once.
* TODO rename Choice -> WindowChoice
* TODO add this comment to the master branch, in Montevideo/Monome/Main.hs
              in [ ((0,6), changeWindow -- This lets us choose
                         [ -- between the layouts in this list.
                           -- `groupAndVal` appears twice because it's
                           -- also something we start with.
* Make St polymrphic in the synth?
  That seems easier, but ugly --
  it would be more natural if the synth was a constructor,
  not a type.
* Use type families?
  to go from a param list to the synth using it,
  or vice-versa
* ParamGroup is a type deeply tied to ZotParam
  It should be called ZotParamGroup.
