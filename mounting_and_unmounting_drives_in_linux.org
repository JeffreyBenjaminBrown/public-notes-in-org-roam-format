** mount
   This mounts the device "sdb1",
   making it available at the "media" folder.

   sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/media
** unmount
   umount /path/where/device/is/mounted
   After this the device will still be visible in /dev,
   but not manipulable at the above long path.
* mount|unmount a drive via a GUI
  Use [[id:c2532854-3f04-4267-91ba-062275b3c2ee][gnome-disk-utility]].
* to find out what preferences are stopping `umount`
  Alternatives. I had better luck with `lsof`.
** lsof           /path/to/folder/to/unmount
** sudo fuser -vm /path/to/folder/to/unmount
