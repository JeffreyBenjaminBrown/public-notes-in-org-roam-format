#+title: moving and movers
* Grill them on what they offer.
** Closet-boxes?
   The kind with a bar to hang clothes on.
** Plastic to wrap delicates?
   esp. mattresses, because how do you wash a mattress?
** Will they take apart the furniture that needs it, and reassemble it?
** Plastic boxes for fridge contents?
** How many people will they send?
   The guys who sent six, and two trucks, got it done in a morning.
   The guys who sent two movers plus one truck and driver took all day,
   which was a miserable experience.
* Don't trust them to estimate how much space we'll need.
** Encomudanzas underestimated
   the boxes we'd need by a factor of 4,
   and the truck we'd need by maybe 25%.
