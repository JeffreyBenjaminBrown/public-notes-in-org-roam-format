#+title: musical exercises
* juggle the [[id:361aa2f3-ae91-42c1-b943-0735eb0983af][musical fundamentals]]
* call and repeat across hands
* build up a chord not knowing what's in it
  rather than aiming for a predetermined target
* meditate in a groove, then radical feel changes
  and while meditating, think of something really different
* fear not parallel changes
* rhythm > pitch
* be melodically comfortable in either hand
