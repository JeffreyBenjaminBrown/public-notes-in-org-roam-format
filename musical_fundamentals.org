#+title: musical fundamentals
* see also [[id:4606bf23-6261-4596-95bc-faf1e9d64b3d][musical exercises]]
* orthogonal sets of elements
** relationships
   mostly for voices?
*** time
    difference in time = offset
    difference in "dt/dt" = speed difference
*** frequency
    difference in f = register
    difference in df / dt = range
*** # of durations
*** # of themes
** transformation parameters | patterns
*** magnitude of change
*** duration of transformation
    shock / drift
*** waves
** transformations
*** freq (parallelism)
**** voices, chords in a scale
**** melodies, chords chromatically
*** time transformations
**** speed, reverse
** object parameters
*** number :: concurrent | serial
    = quantity, count
*** speed : mean (tempo), std dev (syncopation)
*** pitch : mean, std dev, size of pitch set
**** TODO [[id:2b0cc874-56b8-4803-b581-329a2f4a04a1][46-edo / some cool pitch sets]]
*** duration : mean, std dev
*** amplitude : mean, std dev
*** BLOCKED timbre
*** total complexity
** objects
*** note
*** tonal center, chord, scale
*** motif
    rhythm
    melody
    melody modulo rhythm (tone rows)
*** voice
* recently exercised sets of those orthogonal sets of elements
** where "to exercise a set of orthogonal sets" means
*** definition
    To, for each pair of elements one from each pair of sets,
*** example
    to imagine music corresponding to that pair of elements.
    For instance, if two of the orthogonal sets were these:
      {note, voice}
      {number, speed}
    then to exercise that pair of sets would be to imagine each of
      note x number
      note x speed
      voice x number
      voice x speed
*** PITFALL: even a single outer set of is enough
    for instance, I might just exercise "relationships",
    rather than "relationsihps x objects"
** the history
   most recent at top
*** TODO transformation parameters X parameters
*** relationships
*** transformations X objects
*** objects X parameters

** forgetten often :: rhythm | accent | cont* theme | 8ve sep
   *Continue themes. Sometimes radically, always slightly.
** waves & transformations
*** amplitude | rhythm | range
*** speed :: peace | energy
*** *slight* changes
**** micro-melody = variation in a narrow frequently range
**** micro-rhythm = trills, etc.
**** swing (micro-rhythm) helps rhythm
** complexity, number of :: chords | notes | durations | motifs
** pattern duration -  esp. rhythmically uneven chord changes
** voices :: unison || notes / hand || call & response
** mood
*** funk | blues | circus | pop
*** grandeur | wonder | alien | metal | march
** pitch
*** bichords | pedal note | trills, bends
*** diatonic | symmetric | atonal | 24-tone
** intuition v. known

** number of motifs
** waves in
*** TODO the number of voices
*** TODO the complexity of the pitch set
*** amplitude
*** TODO which parameters are complex
** stackd/nested waves
** voices at different amplitudes, speeds
** TODO waves of action and peace
** TODO weird {harmony, ..}
** TODO uneven but unison rhythm across voices
** TODO uneven timing for chord progressions
** TODO bichords
