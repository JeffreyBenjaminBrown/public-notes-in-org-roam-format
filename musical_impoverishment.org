#+title: musical impoverishment
* How can everyone want to listen to the same shitty accordion music?
* How can someonr mere yards from.loud shitty music play a different artist od thw same shitty music on thwir cwll pbone?
* I know there's subtle.diversity to apprwciate among flavors of musiv i  Colombia. That's wxactly the problem. They are too subtlw. Thwre are lots of cat breeds, and also.lots of spg.breeds, but tjat doesnt make cats as diverse as dogs.
