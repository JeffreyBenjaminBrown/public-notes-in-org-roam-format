#+title: musical impoverishment
* How can everyone want to listen to the same shitty accordion music?
* How can someone mere yards from loud shitty music play a different artist of the same shitty music on their cell phone?
* I know there's subtle diversity to apprwciate among flavors of music in Colombia. That's exactly the problem. They are too subtle. Thwre are lots of cat breeds, and also lots of dog breeds, but that doesnt make cats as diverse as dogs.
