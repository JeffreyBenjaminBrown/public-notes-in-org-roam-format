#+title: mutual recursion: an easy example
Imagine a set of nested Russian dolls, some red and some blue.
Opening the red ones is a different skill, "openRed()",
from opening the blue ones, "openBlue()".
To find what's at the center of such a set,
one passes the object back and forth
between openRed() and openBlue()
until they have all been opened.
