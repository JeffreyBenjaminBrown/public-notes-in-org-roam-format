#+title: my left knee: injury and PT saga, beginning February 2022
* how meniscus injuries work
  per [[id:f8c766eb-b0ef-4161-936b-9bc6ab3110fa][Javier Fernando Diaz Cardenas, oste√≥logo]],
  when I [[id:a356af6f-438c-482b-bbdb-0d1ab5eeca50][saw him on April 5th]].
** The edges of tears can be ragged, which can cause pain.
   The hairy-looking edges can fold under,
   interfering with proper movement.
** The entire meniscus can have a floppy part that folds under.
* my story
** 2022 04 05-06, my knee worsened
   Tuesday I had PT and used straps, which I enjoyed.
   That afternoon I saw [[id:f8c766eb-b0ef-4161-936b-9bc6ab3110fa][Dr. Javier Fernando Diaz Cardenas]],
   who proclaimed that it was pretty good,
   and I didn't need to do surgery yet --
   should do another month of PT and then return.
   But he performed a test where he spins my foot outward,
   which hurt, and which I *think* kept hurting throughout the day.
   But still it was pretty good after that.
   I remember carrying the weights I had bought at Decatlon
   on my head afterward, walking normally.

   Then Wednesday morning I had PT again.
   He had me do exercises with five pounds strapped to my leg.
   Weeks earlier I had done similar with four pounds and been fine,
   but this time there was one exercise I just couldn't do due to pain,
   and at least one other that hurt.
   Again I don't remember if the knee was terribly bad immediately thereafter,
   but it certainly was soon.

   Ever since I have not been able to walk normally,
   and it hurts even at complete rest in bed,
   so much that sometimes I have to switch position.

*** Mine hurts when my foot is twisted outward, because it's folding under.
*** It's probably an incomplete tear.
    That is, from one edge inward, but not to the other edge.

   The doctor treats four people at once,
   doesn't ask many questions or spend much time with me.
** 2022 03 09-ish: [[id:9f97ada1-b8d7-4ab0-8708-4d548a028010][Dr. Sebastian Rodriguez]] saw the MRI
   He told me to do a month of PT and come back.
** 2022 03 07, I got an MRI
** 2022 03 03, I saw [[id:9f97ada1-b8d7-4ab0-8708-4d548a028010][Dr. Sebastian Rodriguez Serna]]
   He thinks I've "lesionado" (torn) my meniscus,
   and sent me for an X-ray.
** 2022 02 27, popped my knee
   Was doing the yoga spinal twist,
   with my left knee flat against the floor.
   It made a loud popping sound, which hurt a lot.
   Now my knee has low-level pain all the time,
   and is stiff -- and no longer pops.
