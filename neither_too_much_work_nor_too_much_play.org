#+title: play v. work
* [[id:ff5f634a-f8fa-482c-95a7-6be10e55e58d][Comic responsibility]] seems hard to see in this light.
* If one expects to die and does not know when, and if one dislikes the work, the balance should shift toward more play over time.
* If it's to attract other people, don't overprove yourself -- in particular, at undue expense to the time building the relationships that the proof is aimed at.
