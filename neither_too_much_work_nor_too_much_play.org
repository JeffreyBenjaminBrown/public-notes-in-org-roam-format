#+title: Neither too much work nor too much play.
* If one expects to die and does not know when, and if one dislikes the work, the balance should shift toward more play over time.
* If it's to attract other people, don't overprove yourself -- in particular, at undue expense to the time building the relationships that the proof is aimed at.
