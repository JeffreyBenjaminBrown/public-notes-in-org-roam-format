  The sudo is important -- otherwise lots of stuff survives.

  sudo nix-collect-garbage --delete-older-than 3d
    # keep the last week
  sudo nix-collect-garbage -d
    # keep only latest config
* how to delete profiles when some are named
  # Delete the garbage profiles.
  # PITFALL: This doesn't delete all profiles, which is good.
  # Among maybe a few others,
  # it leaves this important one untouched:
  #   /nix/var/nix/profiles/system-profiles/system
  sudo rm /nix/var/nix/profiles/system-profiles/*

  Be sure I'm on a good wifi connection.

  # Rebuild my profiles (BEFORE collecting garbage!)
  ~/nix/jbb/bash/rebuild-branches.sh

  # Delete old generations
  sudo nix-env -p /nix/var/nix/profiles/system \
    --delete-generations +1

  sudo nix-collect-garbage -d

  # Rebuild boot menu
  sudo nixos-rebuild boot

  # Verify there's only one generation left -- but it's always two
  sudo nix-env -p /nix/var/nix/profiles/system --list-generations

  # List boot configs
  ls /boot/loader/entries
