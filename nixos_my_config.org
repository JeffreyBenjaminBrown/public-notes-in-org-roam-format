  If the app runner stops working that might be why.
  But then I installed an app (`cmatrix`) vis NixOS,
  and it still worked.
* TODO ? stop using deprecated name in libuv derivation
** TODO Do I even use that libuv derivation?
   The phrase `libuv` is nowhere in my config/ folder.
   My derivation is at version 1.34.2,
   whereas nixpkgs has it at 1.42.0.
   I may have [[id:c15685f2-54d8-40dd-a49c-d87ec0bd5034][installed libuv by hand]],
   or libuv may have been pulled from nixpkgs
   without my (directly) mentioning it in my config.
** the file that triggers it
   ~/nix/jbb/custom-packages/libuv/default.nix
** the error
   trace: Warning: `stdenv.lib` is deprecated and will be removed in the next release. Please use `lib` instead. For more information see https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/108938
* TODO should also enable sound if I use Musnix?
  My configuration.nix currently has the line
      sound.enable = true;
* TODO should Musnix know about my external soundcard?
  My config currently contains this:
    # Find this value with `lspci | grep -i audio` (per the musnix readme).
    # PITFALL: This is the id of the built-in soundcard.
    #   When I start using the external one, change it.
    soundcardPciId = "00:1f.3";

* TODO ? m31 will not connect
  I tried adding "samsung-unified-linux-driver" to packages.nix; it would not build. Also it might not be relevant; the description says it's for printers, and does not mention phones.
  This page
    https://forum.kde.org/viewtopic.php?f=224&t=143115
  suggests modifying the "69-libmtp.rules" file. I have five such files. The first I checked already had the change the page describes.
* TODO ? I lost my .stack/config.yaml file
  I had configured it for something ... maybe this, which also appears in my local stack.yaml files?
```
nix:
  enable: true
```
* TODO ? unfinished from 20.09 installation
** transfer from from the old (20.03) configuration.nix
  boot.extraModulePackages = [
      config.boot.kernelPackages.exfat-nofuse ];
  system.autoUpgrade.enable = true;
** ? transfer from the auto-generated configuration.nix file
currently saved at
  jbb-config/install-20.09/by-nixos-generate-config/configuration.nix
I'm not sure I want any of that stuff; I don't know what most of it is.
* PITFALL : switchingo to unstable killed my system
I had to reinstall the OS before I could nixos-rebuild again.
Although I eventually found I could install new stuff with `nix-env -i`.
