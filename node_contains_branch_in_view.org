#+title: node contains branch in view: rel for Skg
* the replacement to make
  [host] contains [branch] ->
  [host] contains [branch] when seen from [perspective]

  Each bracketed role is played by a single node ID.
* file representation
** First node = view. Call it V.
** Second node, or first if there's only one = the containing node.
** List of contained nodes.
   Any of these contents might also be a view.
   Suppose one is, and call it W.
   In the same tree that V spawned,
   the user can view the contents of W from its perspective,
   alongside its contents from V's (or one or the other).
* emacs representation
** Each heading has two IDs: self and perspective
   perpsective = from host onto self
** If the ID pair is duplicated in saved text, warn and only save one.
** Announce it if the perspective from self to host differs from that of host to host's host.x
** Branches can bear different relationships to host.
   When there are multiple kinds of branches from a single host,
   group them with descriptive intermediating headings.
