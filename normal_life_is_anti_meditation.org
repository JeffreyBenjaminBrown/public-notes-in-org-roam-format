#+title: normal life is anti-meditation
  "you are always practicing something. If you're like most people, most of the time, you are effectively meditating on what you want, on the things that make you anxious, etc. So it generates a predictable form of dissatisfaction."
  -- Sam Harris, Making sense of meditation (podcast episode), 1:27 -1:28
