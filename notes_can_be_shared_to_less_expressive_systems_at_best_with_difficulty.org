#+title: Notes can be shared to less expressive systems at best with difficulty.
I want to say that ideally the system would let you express anything, and you could just configure your front end to make more or less of that freedom apparent. But people using more expressivity will have trouble at best sharing with people using less, which argues for consolidating them.
