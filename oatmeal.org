#+title: oatmeal
* Someone says 1 oats to 2 water.
* 1 part oats *in* 3 parts water was too wet.
** what I tried
   I filled the French press with 1/3 oats,
   then fill it to the top with water,
   while the oats are still in it,
   such that there's some water in the bottom 1/3
   where the oats are.
