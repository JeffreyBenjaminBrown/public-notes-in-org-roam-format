#+title: oatmeal
* 30 g oatmeal to 1 coffee* cup water.
** (*) I don't know how many cups are in these coffee cups.)
** elaboration
   I ended up using those proportions here (Paulo VI),
   adding oatmeal until it seemed thick enough.
   It took at least 10 minutes.
   By that time I was left with only about 2.1 cups of liquid.
