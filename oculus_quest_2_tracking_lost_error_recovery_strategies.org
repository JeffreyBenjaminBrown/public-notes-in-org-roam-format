#+title: Oculus Quest 2 "Tracking Lost" error recovery strategies
* source
  https://uploadvr.com/tracking-lost-quest-2/
* the list
** complete reset
   not just enter and exit standby
** reset Guardian
   When the error happens, accept the option to turn off 6DOF tracking,
   then reset it in Settings.
** clear Guardian history
** clean the 4 cameras
** change the space
*** more light
*** no reflective surfaces
*** no IR signals (e.g. remote controls)
*** try dimmer lights
** adjust tracking frequency
   It's on "auto" by default but can be set manually.
   In Colombia, as in the US, the electrical frequency is 60 Hz,
   so that's what it should be.
** avoid standby mode
