* PITFALL: [[id:a9b00a40-d165-45a4-a511-bd9b19e82f87][Beware the caveat.]]
* Flaxseeds, chia seeds, walnuts have omega-3 (part of fish oil).
** HOWEVER, by weight, they are much less effective than fish oil.

  They contain ALA (alpha-linoleic acid),
  which the body converts into DHA and EPA.
  On a per-ounce basis, fish oil is 10 to 20 times more efficient
  at delivering EPA, and around 100 times (!) more efficient
  at delivering DHA.
** Flaxseeds are by far the most ALA-dense.
* Avocados, nuts and seeds have other good fats.
