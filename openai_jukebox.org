#+title: Jukebox by OpenAI
* some impressive uses of it
** Uptown Funk jam
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCaya74_NHw
** extensions of Take On Me
   Esp. the changes shortly after 1:15 and 2:15

** algorithmic Nirvana (not based on any particular song)
   This is so coherent -- it comes back to a theme after a minute! --
   that I think it must have been guided.

** continuing a few bars of Billy Jean by Michael Jackson
   starting around 1:44 is the most creative one
