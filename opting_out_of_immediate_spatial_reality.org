#+title: opting out of immediate spatial reality
Just as I've witnessed people opt out of Facebook,
people can opt out of their physical surroundings,
using electronics.
We can, if we so choose,
be exclusively with people who share common projects.
This possibility seems to threaten a far bigger splintering
than the political partisanship that already bothers us so much.
