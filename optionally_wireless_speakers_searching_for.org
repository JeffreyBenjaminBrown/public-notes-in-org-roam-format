* TODO
** TODO Is it *completely* wireless?
   At least one speaker pair was called wireless
   but needed a connection between the speakers and to the wall.
** TODO Does it accept a cable input?
** TODO Will there be a lag for cable input?
   if only one speaker accepts a cable,
   and transmits to the other one via bluetooth,
   lag seems likely.
