#+title: org-roam bugs to report <2025-07-17 Thu>
* missing backlink
  Sometimes a link does not show up in the backlinks,
  even though I can follow it in the forward direction,
  and even after syncing the db (`org-roam-db-sync`).
* aliases in internal nodes triggers "wrong side of point", can't save
  I put this on the Discourse but maybe it belongs on GitHub.
