#+title: org-roam on phone via EC2 and Termux
* how I set up Termux
** be sure it has storage access
** copy my data onto my phone
   and from Termux, copy it into native Termux disk space
** pkg install openssh
** [[id:5868db37-b75b-4491-9846-813659fbc5c3][create a connection script]]
* how I set up the EC2 instance
** I used a Debian t3.micro w/ 8 GB storage
   It doesn't give 750 free hours like t2.micro,
   but over a year it's at least 10 dollars cheaper,
   and after that should be 20.
** sudo apt install -y git zip unzip encfs snap sqlite3 gcc tree
** snap install emacs --classic
** add snap installations to PATH
   # append this line to ~/.profile
   PATH=$PATH:/snap/bin
** [[id:2612af7a-5401-44aa-ad29-1089fffd48e1][copy my data there]]
