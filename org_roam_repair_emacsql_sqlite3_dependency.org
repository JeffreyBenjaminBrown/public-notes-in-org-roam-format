#+title: org-roam / repair `emacsql-sqlite3` dependency
* ref : my thread on org-roam Discourse
  https://org-roam.discourse.group/t/emacsql-sqlite3-has-vanished-from-melpa-and-org-roam-cant-run-without-it/3048
* the problem
  Melpa deleted the package, which org-roam depends on.
  They say it's no longer needed in light of EmaccSQL 4, and problematic.
