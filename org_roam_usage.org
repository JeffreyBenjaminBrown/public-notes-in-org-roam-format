  C-TAB
  That's a standard magit-section command. The org-roam (backlink) buffer relies on magit-section.
  I don't know why there are a few lines of whitespace under each backlink, but this makes them go away.
* to rebuild the cache
  M-x -db-s
* link descriptions are automatically refactored
** maybe only in a newer version than the one I use?
** this can be disabled:

* TODO (broken) linking to headers
** only available in version 1.2
** create header, then run `org-roam-store-link` (C-c L)
   This no longer exists, as of <2023-07-07 Fri>.
** insert it with org-insert-link                (C-c C-l)
This is part of org-mode, not org-roam.
** this has no link
* a backlink is not visible until saved
that is, by saving the file that contains the backlink,
after creating the backlink
* To use a weird symbol (e.g. '\' or ',') in an alias
  Enclose the whole tag in parens.
  Write '\' as \\.
