   Let them disable saving to one of those views of it,
   while permitting edits to the rest of that buffer.
** Bigger, still incomplete solution: Compare edit times.
   Keep a "last saved" time for each buffer.
   Each time a buffer is switched to,
   check the edit times of each file in it,
   and report if any has been changed.
** Hard: How to rebuild a buffer after foreign edits?
