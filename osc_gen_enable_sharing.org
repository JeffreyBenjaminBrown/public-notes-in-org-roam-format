#+title: osc-gen: enable sharing
* Add a (commit and repo)* column to the nodes db
  (*) actually no repo column but a commit-repo table too
* some redundant notes
** 1
   Everyone has to keep a repo with every snapshot they've seen of someone else's notes. The simplest but less space-efficient way would be to clone the whole history.
   Links to someone's data can either encode the source commit, or (better) their org-roam db can encode the most recent commit of every id. Either of these permits them to delete links without breaking your references to their data.
** A
   To modify, keep a map (table) from commit ids to repos,
   and add a "latest commit" column to the nodes table.
