#+title: osc-gen glyphs
* definition
  a 1-char symbol in a node, before but not part of a heading
  shown in a separate "system" font
* TODO problems
** glyphs could be redundant to properties

   Ideally the properties would *show* as those 1-character symbols,
   without the 1-character symbols being a separate part of the text.
* instances
** "}" is a good [[id:d7ba0584-6df0-4c75-96c8-5758b9934e35][prefix for part of an ancestry]].
   to indicate that view-content file-contains its view-container.
** "T" = saving in this file terminates at this branch.
   If the node showing "T" has tree content,
   the user can edit or delete that content on-screen,
   and it will not affect the tree when the view is saved.
** I = has an ID but is not a file
** F = is a file
** link bidirectionality
   If F links to G and vice-versa,
   that should be visible from either link.
   Use the "left right arrow" symbol â†”
   (`C-x 8 RET left right ar RET")
** number of file branches
** number of links to it
** whether a link's label equals its target's title
   Such an indicator would prefix the link itself.
