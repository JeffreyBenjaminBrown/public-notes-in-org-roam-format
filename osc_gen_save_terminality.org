#+title: NAH : save-terminality for osc-gen
* the idea
  A heading can be marked save-terminal,
  whereupon modifications to its view-content
  will not affect its tree-content.
* the motivation
  You might be primarily interested in things other than its file-content, and want to delete that file-content from its view-content.
* why it's hard
  What if the user moves the branch whose view-content is not to affect its file-content?
