#+title: Pain is only sometimes a learning experience.
* Pain directs you to look for something to learn.
* Ideally it would be time-constrained.
  Once you believe you have done the work it implies -- internalizing precautions, for instance -- it would be rational to no longer feel it.
* The problem is that your body/mind can't know for sure whether there is something to learn.
