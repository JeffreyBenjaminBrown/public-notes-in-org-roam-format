#+title: investment payoffs ::: continuous v. lumpy, delayed
* the idea
** Some investments have continuous payoffs
   which are function of how long they have been going (and hence in part on how early you started).
** Others have discrete ("lumpy") payoffs
   which are unreachable without sufficient investment.
** Some are mixed.
* implication: Partial completion can be of almost no value.
** elaboration
   Often it makes the difference between the project's payoff being net positive and net negative.
** instances
*** a Ph.D.
