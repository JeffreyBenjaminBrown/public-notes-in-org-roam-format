#+title: people (some) as rich as rockstars, without anyone being poor
via a UBI
* People whose wealth
* Give everyone enough money to support 20 people.
* People who get popular could still experience millioaire-ness.
** And getting rich that way would feel better than through ruthlessness.
* Note that popularity is not, so far, as profitable as industry.
  i.e. Taylor Swift is estimated to have 1.6 billion dollars
  (per Forbes), while Elon Musk "has" 434 billion.
