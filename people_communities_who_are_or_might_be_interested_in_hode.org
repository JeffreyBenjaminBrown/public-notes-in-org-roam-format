*** **Truth-Aware Context Selection (TACS)**: This project, hosted on GitHub, focuses on mitigating the hallucinations of large language models by selecting context based on its truthfulness. The tool performs truth detection on the context and constructs corresponding attention masks to filter out untruthful information. This project includes a GUI interface for easier interaction and evaluation of context truthfulness [[❞]](https://github.com/ictnlp/TACS).
*** **Context Recall by Ragas*
    This tool measures the extent to which retrieved context aligns with the annotated ground truth answer. It is used to ensure that the information presented is accurate and relevant to the context, enhancing the reliability of responses generated by AI systems [[❞]](https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/concepts/metrics/context_recall.html).
** groups involved in fact-checking
