#+title: persistent Docker data insanity \ Hode
**** BLOCKED This can wait.
     The way it is is strange,
     but I'm not sure I'll ever need to change it.
* the problem
** there are two `typedb-all-linux-x86_64/` folders on my system
** this one has no data in server/data/, which is what I expected
   /var/lib/docker/overlay2/64b314c449c5dbe3461d2f898ba73aa783949c3b4d36c950ffefdca2c28dfd77/diff/opt/typedb-all-linux-x86_64/server/data
** but this one silently mounts and persists data!
   /var/lib/docker/volumes/typedb-data/_data/typedb-all-linux-x86_64/server/data
* TODO try movig /opt/typedb*
  See if moving /opt/typedb* to another folder
  prevents it from persisting data.
