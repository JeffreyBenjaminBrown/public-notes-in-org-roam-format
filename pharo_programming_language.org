#+title: Pharo (programming language)
* a list of features
  https://pharo.org/features

** Somehow "naturally" extensible syntax
** Lots of introspection.
** Lots of hot-swappability.

   One instance of a class can be swapped for another, and all (references and?) back-references will change accordingly.
