#+title: Photons can take thousands of years to exit the sun.
* ref
  https://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2012/04/24/3483573.htm#:~:text=A%20photon%20of%20light%20takes,at%20the%20speed%20of%20light.
* the idea
  It's not exactly the same photon.
  In the sun's core, gamma rays exit something,
  enter something else, and then get re-radiated out again.
* That chain reaction starts with gamma rays, but they can (and usually do?) then work their way down to lower-energy particles.
