#+title: pickled radish
* The ones I made <2023-04-02 Sun>
  Were already tasty in a few hours.
  I never took them out of the brine,
  and never boiled the brine.
  I put the in the fridge after a day,
  came back to them a week after that.
  Include no surgar, no herbs.
  Used what I guessed might be a measuring cup and a teaspoon.
* recipe
** 2 parts water to 1 part vinegar
** 1 tsp salt per cup of water
** they recommend sugar but meh
* TODO use herbs
* TODO mystery : How long to leave in vinegar?
  Maybe forever?
  Judging from some cursory online search, it's not clear.
* TODO mystery : How long to leave outside?
  Judging from some cursory online search, at most a week.
