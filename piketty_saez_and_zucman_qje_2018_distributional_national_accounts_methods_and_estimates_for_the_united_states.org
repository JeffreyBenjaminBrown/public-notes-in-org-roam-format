#+title: Piketty, Saez And Zucman, Qje 2018, "Distributional National Accounts: Methods And Estimates For The United States".
* [[id:a328d67f-f128-4d73-bc4d-76ee16a8874a][National Income]]
* What's special about it
** "capture 100% of national income'
** "compute growth rates for each quantile of the income distribution consistent with macroeconomic growth."
** "We estimate the distribution of both pretax and posttax income"
* Results: Since 1980 in the US,
** Average income rose 60%.
** Income went nowhere for the bottom 50% since 1980.
** It rose 40% for the "middle class", percentiles 50% through 90%,
*** "faster than what tax and survey data suggest"
*** "due in particular to the rise of tax-exempt fringe benefits"
** It boomed for the top.
*** Most of this boom is due to increasing returns to capital.
** Government has offset little of the rise in inequality.
** Re. gender
*** "The reduction of the gender gap in earnings has mitigated the increase in inequality among adults".
*** The "share of women falls steeply as one moves up the labor income distribution, and is only 11% in the top 0.1% in 2014."
