** I think `lsblk` should do the trick.
** In these instructions, they are assumed to be /dev/sda<x>,
   where <x> varies across partitions.
   But on the tiny server it's /dev/nvme0n1p<x> --
   note the `p` between the last 1 and the <x>.
** Partitions of that drive sometimes end in pN rather than N
   where N is some low integer.
   I suspect the `p` is inserted when the name of the drive ends in a number
   -- e.g. `nvme0n1` becomes `nvme0n1p2`
   where `sda` would have just become `sda2`.
