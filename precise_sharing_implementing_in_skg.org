#+title: precise sharing, implementing in skg
* making data available precisely*
  (*) across receivers and across the data
** noe solution is provided by USB sticks
   If you have a USB stick,
   you can do this.

   Direct file transfer would let you be more selective.
   If there are broken links they could send you requests for further access.
** another: make a repo for you & each of those you share privately with
   that, plus a public and private repo,
   are all you would need.
   Your shared private repos can be single-commit,
   hence small.
** For either solution, who a file is shared with could be a property of the file.
** Enforcing confidentiality seems impossible.
   If you give someone information, they have it.
   They can tell someone it came from you.
   If you don't want them to be able to do that,
   you'll have to avoid giving it to them.
