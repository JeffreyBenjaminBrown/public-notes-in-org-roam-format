#+title: predictive coding ( cognitive science )
* = the theory that
  the brain's higher-order models send predictions to lower-level models, and what lower-level models report up is mostly deviations from those predictions.
* implication: Changing your models changes your perceptions.
  or at least reaches in that direction
  (that is, from the higher-level models to the lower-level input).
