#+title: preregistration
* a.k.a. "pre-analysis plan"
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preregistration_(science)
* TODO read Ed Miguel's work on preregistration
* Seems to solve even more problems than you might think.
  This is what I remember from someone's presentation of it
  at PUJ before 2020.
** solves the problem of [[id:941aef35-0419-4a8d-8e80-e4703a1f36dd][losing negative results (scientific publishing problem)]]
** solves the [[id:ccc083c0-4785-447c-9f24-f9780b8d1445][duplication of futile research agendas]]
** can't cherry-pick regressions
** can't adjust a treatment mid-experiment
** journals can accept before knowing the results, eliminating bias
