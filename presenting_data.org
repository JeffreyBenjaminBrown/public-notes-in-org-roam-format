#+title: presenting data
* TODO how to summarize a history of traversals
  could be to varying degrees, e.g. same-day visits
  counted rather than ordered
* plots
* bars
** stacking bars
   the ordering and {coloring, manner of visually distinguishing}
   of parts must
   be the same across bars
* fun: overlay a third axis
  which the other two stretch strangely,
  and the parallels from which might have to
  be not parallel (more than locally)
* pie charts
  fun ifup is a different direction each time you look
* time series
* to represent an arbitrary number of intervals in a line
  just write its name at the start of a block of a different color
* compare the evolution of two series
  share a time axis, use a different other axis
* knowledge graph paths
** A concept could, experientially, envelop another.
   One never reaches the inner without traversing it.
** project the graph onto 2 dimensions
*** spacing > global vector
    the dimensions globally close to meaningless,
    the dots spaced to between them maximize
    how to draw
*** paths that double back on each other
* confidence intervals
* vector fields
* heat maps
* level sets and contour maps
* treemap
