#+title: Prevent git credential validators from popping up whenever I deal with a remote on GitHub over HTTP.
* motivation
  http & github are how the repos in [[id:f9ee18e9-68f2-4f10-b10d-c91186b797e3][Agora]] are described --
  see agora/sources.yaml.
* how I'm trying to do it
  serial
** I installed the GitHub CLI (`gh` in nixpkgs).
** I created a personal access token
  giving it permissions for `repo`
  (including all of its subcategories)
  and `read:org`.

  (Doing that is described here:
    https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token
  )
** I saved that token in my passwords.
** I ran `gh auth login`,
   selecting all the defaults until it whether and how to authenticate,
   then saying yes, choosing `paste an authentication token`,
   and pasting the token from the previous step.
