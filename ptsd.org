* In the US, 9% of people develop it at some point in their lives.

* Young children are surprisingly resistant to it.
  "Young children are less likely to show distress, but instead may express their memories through play."

* "in the absence of therapy, symptoms may continue for decades"
* Social support matters.
** Having a good support network helps.
** "The likelihood of sustained severe symptoms is also higher if people around the survivor ignore (or are ignorant of) the rape or blame the rape survivor."
* Most trauma does not lead to it.
  In one study the most predictive situation was sexual assault on a woman, and even it only resulted in PTSD 19% of the time.
* It is both over- and under-reported.
  Over-reported for benefits.
  Under-reported for stigma, etc.
* Preemptive "psychological debriefing" seems not to work and might be harmful.
  "meant to allow individuals to directly confront the event and share their feelings with the counselor and to help structure their memories of the event"
