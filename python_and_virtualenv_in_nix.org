#+title: Python and virtualenv in Nix
* it's easy
  Apparently, the new way to set up a Python virtual environment on Nix (https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Python) is exactly what you would do outside of Nix:
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
* a slight confusion: source v. "."
  The above is *slightly* different from what's recommended in the Agora docs (https://github.com/flancian/agora):
    python3 -m venv venv
    . venv/bin/activate
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
  After experimenting, they seem to do the same thing, in different folder names (.venv vs. env). Not sure why "." works instead of "source", though.
