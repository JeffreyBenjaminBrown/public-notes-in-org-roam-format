#+title: QJackCtl having no effect on `jack_bufsize`.
* posted to NixOS Discourse
  https://discourse.nixos.org/t/jack-buffer-size-unaffected-by-changes-made-in-qjackctl/57170
* `jack_bufsize` can be run from the shell, and always gives 1024.
  regardless of how I change it in QJackCtl.
* Yet QJackCtl does control other things -- namely the signal graph.
