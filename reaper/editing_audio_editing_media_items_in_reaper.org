     Moves the region by its length.

*** slip editing works on adjacent boundaries
    e.g. if an item was split,
    the dividing line can be moved for both sides simultaneously.
** Pencil Mode: draw a copy of the selected region
*** what it is
    Select a region.
    Ctrl-drag somewhere else.
    This will create a copy of the region.
    If the drawn copy is longer than the original,
    and the original used to be longer,
    it will go on to include whatever used to be part of the original.
*** there are four variations
    Apply snapping (only if snapping is enabled),
    or don't (even if it's enabled).
    Pool MIDI source data, or don't.

  snapping is enabled, snapping will be applied when you select the area to be trimmed.

 you can move them together, set them all to a common color,
 mute and unmute them, and so on)

    The Actions List (chapter 15) include actions to move or copy the contents of a time selection to the
 cursor position. These are Time selection: move contents of time selection to edit cursor (moving later
 items) and Time selection: copy contents of time selection to edit cursor (moving later items).
** overriding the editing of other selected items when one is edited

    Maybe the Ctrl modifier lets you do that for other edits.
    Certainly it works for slip editing, as described below.
*** doing that for slip editing: quote
     To slip edit several items in different tracks, select all the media items
 required (for example, hold the Ctrl key while clicking in turn on each
 item, or use the marquee method), then slip edit any selected item. The
 change will be applied to all items in the selection (see left), relative to
 their individual positions on the timeline. You can use Ctrl left drag if
 instead of this if you want only one item to be edited.

** "Propagating Item" properties to similarly named items.
*** PITFALL: [[id:21bbb484-4a5a-476f-9130-3714cb9342cf][This is badly named.]]
*** the two varieties:
    "Propagate item to similarly named items on track"
    "Propagate item to similarly named items" (all tracks)
** "Implode Items To One Track"
   collects an across-track selection of items to a single track,
   preserving each one's positioning/timing.
** normalizing audio items
*** two ways to normalize a selection of items at once
    One is to give them "common gain".
    In this case, only the one with the loudest peak will reach maximum volume
      (at some point).
    The other is not to do that, in which case they all do (at some point).

**** FX might render as audio
     quote
     Note 1: When MIDI items are glued, any item that includes take FX such as a VSTi synth is rendered as audio.
**** Channel number might rise.
     quote
     Note 2: Actions are available in the Actions List (see Chapter 15) to ensure that when an item is glued, its
 channels will be increased if necessary to accommodate the output of any item FX. For example, if the action
 Item: Glue items (auto increase channel count with take FX) is applied to an item with FX which use two
 channels for output, then that item will be rendered in stereo (two channels) when glued.
