    Tip: The View, Piano Roll Timebase command includes the options source beats, project beats and project
 time. MIDI data is always defined in beat-based terms, but in the time view mode the grid is adjusted to reflect
 any tempo changes in the project. If there are no tempo changes, the beat and time views will be identical. You
 also have the option to select Project synced. This synchronizes the timeline of the project and MIDI item
 together. It also ensures that both windows are synchronized during such actions as zooming and scrolling.
** "The MIDI Editor follows your Arrange view settings."

** the view of MIDI notes and other MIDI parameters
*** DONE tags : CC value, CC parameter
*** how to read it
    Notes are typically displayed in the big window.
    Below that is a little "CC lane", by default showing veloity.
*** how to configure it
    alternatives
**** the context menu
     from right-clicking on the gray bar *above* the CC lane
**** the widgets on the left side of the CC lane
     The drop-down menu at the left of the CC lane offers other CC parameters.
     The small + to the right of that menu permits adding another lane.
**** color notes/CC by channel : C-S-M-c
