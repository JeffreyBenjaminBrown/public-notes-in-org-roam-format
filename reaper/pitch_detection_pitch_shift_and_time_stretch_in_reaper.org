   Drag one side. The other side of the selection stays fixed.
   Any notes whose start and endpoints are both strictly inside
   the selection's boundaries will have both endpoints moved.

* Use ReaPitch to make harmonies.
* Use ReaTune to make pitch corrections.
* Use "stretch markers" to stretch selected items in sync.
* Use ReaTune to tune an instrument.
  It lets you input a Hz value,
  so its fixed assumption of 12-edo can be overridden.
* Use ReaVoice to control an audio clip's pitch via MIDI
