#+title: plugins in Reaper
* my procedure
Open Preferences (Ctrl-P),
and go to Plugins.
Each "path" (to VST, to LV2, etc.) is a semicolon-separated list of paths.
Many or all of them should be, or should at least include, the paths in the corresponding Bash variable, as in
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
[jeff@jbb-hp24-oled:~]$ echo $LV2_PATH
/home/jeff/.nix-profile/lib/lv2:/run/current-system/sw/lib/lv2:/etc/profiles/per-user/jeff/lib/lv2:/home/jeff/.lv2
#+END_SRC
Then I should click "rescan plugins".
* If it doesn't work, [[id:86128580-cc10-4279-87b6-8c869dc44b8e][this might help]].
