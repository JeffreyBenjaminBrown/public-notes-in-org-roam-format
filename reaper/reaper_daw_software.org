** [[id:c262c184-c00a-4bdf-9565-9d32a6d33797][What is a "parent channel"?]]
** Of these four "view modes" (for track wiring?), not all were introduced before being referred to.
   routing matrix
   grouping matrix	???
   region render matrix ???
   track wiring

   One view is at the bottom, where each track is vertical.
   Another is at the top left, where each track is horizontal.
** "When possible, get your project timebase settings right before you record or import any items."
   you can still over-ride the project timebase setting for individual tracks

    playback, recording, maybe region-selection, more
*** what the Transport Bar is
    A thin horizontal bar with playback controls,
    time coordinates, BPM, more stuff.
*** controlling them
**** Show Transport Bar: C-M-t

    Offline FX consume no CPU.
*** Presets: Many more can be downloaded.
    "As well as the presets supplied with REAPER, you can download further sets by visiting http://stash.reaper.fm/ and following the link to FX Preset Libraries."
*** The default preset for an FX can be set.
*** Whole subchains can be bypassed.
*** "Analyzing FX Performance" is a thing.
** Buses and routing
*** Buses are for sharing resources among tracks.
*** "Toggle on/off send from track to Master"
    Hold Alt while clicking Route.
    Works with multi-track selections too.
*** "Create a quick send on the fly from one track to another."
