#+title: recording (audio & MIDI) \ Reaper
* skipped in manual
** Recording a Trackâ€™s Output
** Recording FX Bus Output
** Recording with External Hardware FX
** Recording an Internet Audio Stream
* configuring the [[id:799c16f7-07d2-43d0-b370-d4871807a73b][default recording behavior]]
* [[id:78f34326-cc2e-4c26-8f21-feddb161c2d3][Overlapping Items in the same track]] can matter
* [[id:ec7ee8b0-1923-4724-8e92-bf5fc5e5b908][C-r : Start (and stop?) recording]]
* [[id:046cf634-cd68-4099-9528-d67be000ef74][One track can hold both MIDI and audio.]]
* Save behavior depends on how recording is stopped.
  quoteing the manual:

  If you use the Record button or
  Ctrl R to stop recording, recorded
  items are automatically saved.
  If you press Space or Stop, the
  dialog box shown will let you save or
  delete any or all of your newly
  recorded media items.
* arming tracks
** auto-arming selected tracks is an option

*** xquote from manual (v. 6.70)
    Select the track(s) then right click over the record arm button for any track in the selection and
    choose Automatic record arm when track selected. This command can be toggled on and off.
    To set all tracks to auto arm, choose the Track command from the main menu, then Set all tracks to
    automatic record arm when selected.
*** can be per-track or for all tracks
* The [[id:975d6340-3da2-442d-aac1-8b91aa51caf7][metronome in Reaper is highly configurable]].
* Stereo and even more-multichannel tracks are possible.
** Both mono and stereo tracks can be placed in the stereo spectrum.
* punch recording (punch in, punch out)
** what it is
   Set the time when recording will start,
   and another when it will stop.
   Start playback from before the start marker.
   Recording (but not playback) stops at the end marker.
** how to use it
   serial
*** Select that mode from the (top-level) Options.
    It's called "Record mode: time selection auto punch".
*** Disable some things
**** Disable :: "Toggle Repeat" in the transport bar.
**** Disable :: Options / Show all takes (when room) [[id:fdc1864d-aafb-49c0-a15a-2be55de37905][(can use C-l)]]
**** Disable :: Options / Loop points linked to time selection
*** Select a region.
    Do this by clicking on in the track itself.
    There doesn't need to be a clip there already.
    Clicking on the timeline above the tracks
    defines some other kind of region, I'm guessing loop regions.
** By default it is non-destructive.
   But destructive is another kind available in (top-level) Options.
* [[id:ec930cf4-e05c-4ff1-a643-82b6fb0b56fa][Automatic fades and crossfades are an option.]]
* Tracks can hold alternative or *concurrent* items.
** "Multiple Takes" (of the same region) is a thing.
   see in the manal:
*** Recording Multiple Takes
*** Displaying Multiple Takes
*** Using Color Coded Takes
*** Working With Multiple Takes
** "Free Item Positioning" (FIPM) has something to do with these.
*** I think it's to let the user drag items vertically within a track.
*** TODO Is it to enable concurrent items in a track?

* Use empty events to define multiple punch-in regions
** ref
   Recording with Empty Events
   in the manual
** procedure
   serial
*** Choose Options / Record mode: Auto-punch selected items
*** To make an empty event
    Highlight a region on the track and choose
    Insert / Empty item
*** Ctrl-click to select some events.
*** Each selected event now defines a punch-in / punch-out region.
* Recording can be post-FX.
** ref
   Recording with Input FX Plug-ins
* the Virtual MIDI Keyboard
** M-b: Toggle its display.
* virtual MIDI ports
  let you have more than 16 per track, I guess
* MIDI recording has many modes

** Switch it in the TCP.
** Examples
*** add notes
*** replace all notes
*** replace only overlapping notes.
*** record notes post MIDI FX
* looped recording
  see in manual:
  Looped Overdubbing and Looped Time Selection Recording
** PITFALL: Complex interaction with the [[id:d155fd04-9d9e-4d8e-a438-5eea3c66b54c][many modes of MIDI recording]].
* Each track can have a different default recording format.
