* [[id:e35457fe-af25-4ea3-924d-a8b39f138a59][M-r : open it]]
* TODO [[id:3ae229ac-92c8-416c-a69a-d8573515b1d4][How is the Track Wiring View different from the Routing Matrix?]]
* what it is
  It's a binary matrix,
  with tracks and inputs on one axis,
  and tracks and (I assume) outputs on the other.
* Its view can be simplified by toggling the option "Show non-standard stereo channel pairs"
