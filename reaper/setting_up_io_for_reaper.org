#+title: audio and MIDI IO in Reaper
* Some people prefer ALSA.
  Apparently JACK (and PulseAudio) both tell ALSA what to do.
* how I set up audio and MIDI in JACK
  serial
** Start Qjackctl (GUI).
** Start `a2jmidid` (command line).
** In Reaper / Preferences / Device, use JACK.
   It's probably already there.
** In Reaper / Preferences / MIDI Devices, enable receipt from a2jmidid.
   This creates a connection in the JACK graph,
   so I won't need to manipulate that graph myself.
** In the JACK graph, connect SuperCollider to Reaper's in1 and in2.
** In Reaper, make some track read in stereo from in1 and in2.
* the Virtual MIDI Keyboard
