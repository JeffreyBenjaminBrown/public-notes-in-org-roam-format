#+title: Takes are complicated. \ Reaper
I mostly skipped that stuff.
* refs
  In the Recording chapter, sections 3.19-3.22
  In the FX chaper, section 6.4
  In the Editing chapter, section 7.19.
  All of chapter 8, "takes".
  If I'm still missing something, search for the word "take".
    Fortuantely it appears not to be used in its other sense.
