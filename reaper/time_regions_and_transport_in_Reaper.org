   "When possible, get your project timebase settings right before you record or import any items."
** Individual tracks can override project timebase settings.
** Tempo Maps can be detected automatically from transients.
   This is useful for drawing a changing timebase
   over material recorded without a click.

* Jumping (C-j) lets you enter coordinates to send the cursor to.
* Regions and Markers
** Both can be defined, managed, and used to define edits.
** Markers are like bookmarks.

*** m : create numbered marker
*** number keys : jump to that numbered marker
*** S-m : create named marker
*** [ and ] : go to previous and next marker
*** C-j : open the Jump Dialog.
    Type a name or number to go there.
*** M-click : delete marker
*** loop region between markers : double-click between them
    on either the marker bar or the time ruler
*** zoom to selection
    The only way I've managed is with the right-click context menu
** The time selection start and end are treated as floating markers.
   so [ and ] include them as targets to jump to.
** PITFALL: Marker names =START and =END are special.

   They are used for rendering.
* Transients can be used to define times.
  At least for the creation of loops (the edit),
  but I imagine also for regions and time selections.
