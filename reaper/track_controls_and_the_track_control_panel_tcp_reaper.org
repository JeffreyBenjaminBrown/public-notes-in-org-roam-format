* PITFALL: [[id:f9078ad5-9518-4672-b11a-4aabaa905e32][Two views of the track controls can be visible at once.]]
* the Track Control Panel (TCP)
** One way to open it: Right-click on the track's Arm button.

* a track's Route button
  controls where it goes.
  controls the volume at which it goes there.
* configurable: [[id:51286989-c0e3-4ccf-8724-86d0b7ce919a][whether track "metering" is pre- or post-fader]]
* adjust many tracks at once
  Ctrl-click each relevant track control panel,
  then adjust any to adjust all.
** PITFALL: toggles (at least record-arm) in a group will stay out of sync
   If two tracks are selected,
   and one of them is armed and the other not,
   toggling "armament" will toggle both,
   so it will still be the case that one is armed and the other not.
* Alt-solo to silence the soloed track's sends.

  :END:
  The alternative is "solo in place", where sends are heard too.
** TODO How can you hear the track if it's not sending anywhere?
* [[id:c0ba8a8a-ddcb-4f2b-afe2-7d8344cabb6b][Each track can have a different default recording format.]]
