** [[id:f9078ad5-9518-4672-b11a-4aabaa905e32][Two views of the track controls can be visible at once.]]
** [[id:1fdafc48-468f-4bc6-a749-52e6c0bf5dcf][To read about stereo operations, look for the term "channel".]]
* [[id:0604f99a-8c15-499e-9579-6a1c01a0eda2][Single tracks can be based off of "Templates".]]
* the Track Control Panel (TCP)

** "Free Item Positioning" (FIPM) enables it.
*** I think it's to let the user drag items vertically within a track.
** [[id:cd8e2baf-26de-4f29-a459-928d78c5b46a][multiple Takes of the same region of a track]]
* track mix (controls and view)
** the Route button
   controls where it goes.
   controls the volume at which it goes there.
** configurable: [[id:51286989-c0e3-4ccf-8724-86d0b7ce919a][whether track "metering" is pre- or post-fader]]
** Alt-solo will silence the soloed track's sends.
   The alternative is "solo in place", where sends are heard too.
** [[id:2f4508ff-27e2-47ed-8b63-0e9de771800f][Track volume, pan, and maybe more can be nudged.]]
* adjust many tracks at once
  Ctrl-click each relevant track control panel,
  then adjust any to adjust all.
** PITFALL: toggles (at least record-arm) in a group will stay out of sync
   If two tracks are selected,
   and one of them is armed and the other not,
   toggling their, uh, armament will toggle both,
   so it will still be the case that one is armed and the other not.
* [[id:c0ba8a8a-ddcb-4f2b-afe2-7d8344cabb6b][Each track can have a different default recording format.]]
* [[id:2f4508ff-27e2-47ed-8b63-0e9de771800f][Track volume, pan, and maybe more can be nudged.]]
* [[id:fca74669-9d61-462a-b9ef-7ca20ffc4801][Stereo and even more-multichannel tracks are possible.]]
* virtual MIDI ports

  let you have more than 16 per track, I guess
