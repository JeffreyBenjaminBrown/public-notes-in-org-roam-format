* TODO resume reading
** Stale: RESUME at page 50 (section 3, recording)
   That was true for my copy of the manual for version 6.5,
   but now I'm on 6.7

* questions
** [[id:c262c184-c00a-4bdf-9565-9d32a6d33797][What is a "parent channel"?]]
** Of these four "view modes" (for track wiring?), not all were introduced before being referred to.
   routing matrix
   grouping matrix	???
   region render matrix ???
   track wiring
** What did I mean by
*** [[id:6114e6e3-45f8-4d60-81a1-daaaae10c02a][Scrubbing does not affect playback]]
*** [[id:5f08678c-8574-4938-87b3-efb4da1b8799][Alt-solo to silence the soloed track's sends.]]
* PITFALLs
** Two views of the track controls might be visible at once.

   One view is at the bottom, where each track is vertical.
   Another is at the top left, where each track is horizontal.
** "When possible, get your project timebase settings right before you record or import any items."
   you can still over-ride the project timebase setting for individual tracks
* vocab
** "MCP" = "Mixer control panel"
** "TCP" = "Track contrl panel"
* how to use it
** Settings can be backed up.
   see "Backing up Settings"
** Folders and file types are documented
   see "REAPER’s Installed Folders and File Location"
   see "REAPER File Types"
** [[id:87336c4a-073b-42fe-a0d0-40f9cece91f6][Reaper is surprisingly configurable.]]
** Transport and the Transport Bar
*** "Transport" includes
    playback, recording, region-selection, more
*** what the Transport Bar is
    A thin horizontal bar with playback controls,
    time coordinates, BPM, more stuff.
*** controlling them
**** Show Transport Bar: C-M-t
**** Record: C-r
     Does not stop playback.
**** Play|Stop: SPC
**** Toggle Repeat: r
**** Pause: Enter
**** Stop v. Pause
     Stop returns the cursor to where it started.
**** Nudge left|right: C-(left|right)
**** Play skipping loop section: M-SPC
**** Scrubbing does not affect playback.

     Grab the down-pointing triangle on top of the plauback mark,

*** Use Alt to audition changes.
    The fader will go back to where it was afterward.
*** Hold Ctrl for finer mouse adjustments.
*** Scroll wheel (two-finger scroll?) also works if enabled.
** Track controls
*** PITFALL: [[id:f9078ad5-9518-4672-b11a-4aabaa905e32][Two views of the track controls can be visible at once.]]

    controls where it goes.
    controls the volume at which it goes there.
*** surprisingly configurable
*** configurable: [[id:51286989-c0e3-4ccf-8724-86d0b7ce919a][whether track "metering" is pre- or post-fader]]
*** adjust many tracks at once
    Ctrl-click each relevant track control panel,
    then adjust any to adjust all.

** "Navigation and Zooming"
*** C-M-(up|down) to jump tracks.
*** lots of track display controls
**** Press @ to "Minimise all tracks."
**** Toggle height of all tracks between minimised, normal and maximised.
     double-click vertical scroll bar
*** (+|-) to zoom in|out in time
*** Alt-arrow (all four directions) to scroll within a project
*** mouse has four scroll|zoom modes
**** no modifier - horizontal scroll
**** Alt - horiz scroll
**** Ctrl - vertical zoom
**** C-M - vertical scroll

*** PITFALL: Terminology: "FX" is both singular and plural.
    (in the manual)
*** There's a book about it.
    ReaMix: Breaking the Barriers with REAPER
*** "F" to open the "FX Browser"
*** There are lots of shortcuts.
*** FX "Chain"s can be saved.
*** Individual FX can be "bypassed" (C-b) or "offline"d (C-M-b).
    Offline FX consume no CPU.
*** There are many more downloadable presets.
    "As well as the presets supplied with REAPER, you can download further sets by visiting http://stash.reaper.fm/ and following the link to FX Preset Libraries."
*** The default preset for an FX can be set.
*** Whole subchains can be bypassed.
*** "Analyzing FX Performance" is a thing.
** Buses and routing
*** Buses are for sharing resources among tracks.
*** "Toggle on/off send from track to Master"
    Hold Alt while clicking Route.
    Works with multi-track selections too.
*** "Create a quick send on the fly from one track to another."
    "In TCP or MCP, drag and drop from send track ROUTE button to receive track’s.
** "Time selection"s and "Time loop"s
*** They can be the same thing ("linked"), or not.
*** "Snapping" (to markers or something) is toggleable.
*** Press "R" to toggle "Repeat".
*** Esc to undefine the loop region.
*** "Managing Time and Loop Selections" (modifying them)
**** Keyboard or mouse.
**** Their edges can be moved.
**** They can be shifted.
** "Jumping" permits precise changes to the focused time.
** Editing is non-destructive.
   Reaper does not delete files.
** Routing
*** A track's "Routing button" leads to its sends and receives.

*** Per-track "playback time offset" can compensate for latency.
*** Sends and receives can be before or after fader, pan and FX.
    Three kinds: "Post Fader (Post Pan), Pre-Fader (Post FX) and Pre FX."
*** Alt-R: open the "Routing Matrix"
**** Its display can be simplified by toggling the option "Show non-standard stereo channel pairs"
     (2,3) is an example of a nonstandard pair.
