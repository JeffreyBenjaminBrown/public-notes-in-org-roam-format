* create a new project
  rebar3 new <template> <project name>
** possible values for `template`
*** app
    a stateful OTP application with a supervision tree, as a single application project
*** lib
    a library OTP application (without supervision trees), useful for grouping together various modules, as a single application project
*** release
    an umbrella project ready to be released
*** escript
    a special form of single application project that can be built as a runnable script

   But by default there's only one.
* dependencies
