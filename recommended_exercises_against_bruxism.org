Ms. Cocca recommends daily repetitions of pulling your head back into your neck as if you were trying to retreat from someone leaning in for a kiss and also nodding your head down until your chin touches the base of your throat.

Other good exercises are squeezing your shoulder blades together and holding, as well as putting your arms up like a goal post and leaning into a doorway to stretch out your chest.
