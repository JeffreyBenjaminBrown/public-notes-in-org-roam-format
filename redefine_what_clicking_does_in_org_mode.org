#+title: redefine what clicking does in org-mode
* ref : my Stack Exchange question
  https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/44763/changing-the-name-of-the-function-key-mouse-1-leads-to-problems
* motivation
  On the phone, typing "C-x 1" each time I open a new buffer
  slows me down a lot.
* what I tried
  (define-key org-mode-map [mouse-1]         'jbb-org-open-at-point)
  (define-key org-mode-map (kbd "<mouse-1>") 'jbb-org-open-at-point)
* where the code goes (once it works)
  Right after this line:

  (define-key org-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-o")   'jbb-org-open-at-point)
