#+title: redefine what clicking does in org-mode
* ref : my Stack Exchange question
  https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/76694/define-key-redefines-behavior-of-slow-mouse-click-but-not-fast-mouse-click/76695#76695
* question history
  I asked on Stack Exchange, <2023-04-07 Fri>.
  I got a quick response, but it was unhelpful.
  THen I changed the question a lot,
  realizing that click duration matters.
  Nobody has responded as of <2023-04-13 Thu>.
* motivation
  On the phone, typing "C-x 1" each time I open a new buffer
  slows me down a lot.
* what I tried
  (define-key org-mode-map [mouse-1]         'jbb-org-open-at-point)
  (define-key org-mode-map (kbd "<mouse-1>") 'jbb-org-open-at-point)
* where the code goes (once it works)
  Right after this line:

  (define-key org-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-o")   'jbb-org-open-at-point)
