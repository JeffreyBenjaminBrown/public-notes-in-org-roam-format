#+title: scheduling reevaluation
* source
  someone on the 80k podcast
  (which somewhere online is transcribed to text),
  2025/04/24
  who called the idea "reevaluation points".
* why
  By fixing a time at which you will reconsider whether something is a good idea, you both ensure that you'll eventually do that, and free yourself from the constant nagging feeling that maybe now is the time.
* counterargument
  Why not do it right away? If you feel nagged about it, that's a problem -- either your intuition is wrong, or it's not. Either way it seems worth paying attention.
