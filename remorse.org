#+title: remorse + regret
* the difference
** Remorse connotes negative ethical self-judgment.
* "compounding remorse" (or resentment)
  If left unresolved for a while,
  the feeling can intensify.
** "regrets of action are intense, but only in the short term, while regrets of inaction gains intensity over time and dominates [sic] people's experience"
* can be useful
* Education is the leading regret in the West.
* People anticipate regret and try hard to avoid it.
  Maybe too hard --
  we overestimate the regret we will feel.
  But that might be a good bias, countering another:
  "[the overestimation appears to be] due to a tendency to underestimate the extent to which people attribute bad outcomes to external factors rather than to internal factors"
* art & remorse
