#+title: remote jamming
I'm not actually finding great remote MIDI jam resources. Here's the best I found:

  ** https://github.com/elieserdejesus/JamTaba/
     Uses ninjam servers.
     Talks about MIDI but I can't actually tell if it's streaming MIDI.

  ** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoyMuRLJr-g&t=4s
     No programming, just sending MIDI to someone else's DAW.
     Requires control of your router (to open ports 5004 and 5005, IIRC),
     which I don't have -- my ISP installs their own router.

Jamulus and Jammr are other pieces of remote jamming software, but they send audio.
