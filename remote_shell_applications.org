#+title: remote shell applications
* a discussion
  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29081008
* `ssh` is the canonical remote shell.
* Mosh and ET are the two big improvements to ssh.
  I think I prefer ET.
** Both require running a corresponding server version of the same app.
** Eternal Terminal (ET): Never dies. Does not improve latency.
   Does not solve the latency problem.
** Mosh: Never dies, solves latency problem, but sacrifices screen history.
   Good: faster response, automatic reconnect.
   Bad: Screen history is (inaccurate? limited?).
     Tmux fixes this, but at the cost of the fast response,
     at which point why not just use ET.
