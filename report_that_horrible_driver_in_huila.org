#+title: STALE - report that horrible driver in Huila
* He took us, I think, from San Agustin to Mano del Gigante.
* I have his photo, from around Jan 5 2023
* Passed another bus on a narrow two lane highway and paralleled him to ask a question. The other didn't respond, just honked. Had a truck come by at that time we would have been hit even if we had braked completely
* Let someone stand behind me. I. A wreck would have killed us both.
* On our bus from San Ag to Gigante, Jan 5
