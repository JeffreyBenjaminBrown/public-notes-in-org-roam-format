#+title: Represent, record, or suggest changes.
* some kinds of changes
** A difference between two {lists, sets}.
** Creations and deletions of relationships
* Other relevant changes should easy to view from one change.
  That is, regardless of the kind of change (list, graph, ...)
  if it involved expression E then it is easy to see all the change.
  If those changes are all visible from a given context,
  make that clear too, and make them viewable within it
  (like a git diff of a passage of org-roam text).
