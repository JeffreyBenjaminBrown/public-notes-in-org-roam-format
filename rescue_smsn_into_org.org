#+title: rescue smsn into org
* understand SmSn data
  in universal:
  grep for each line that starts with @
  keep only the first word (stop at whitespace)
  uniquify
* build org files
  Build trees from every uncontained node.
  Where they overlap, pick one ancestor
  at random to be the context.
  Once a context is fat (easiest measure: max # of nodes),
  remove it from the pool of containers.
