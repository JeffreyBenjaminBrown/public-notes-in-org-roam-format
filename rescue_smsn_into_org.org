#+title: rescue smsn into org
* [[id:aae78160-aab9-4355-ab41-93a2108798e0][Will updating my SmSN notes be hard with Skg?]]
* TODO take data source into account when building docs
  All nodes in a doc must belong to the same repo.
* understand SmSn data
  in universal:
  grep for each line that starts with @
  keep only the first word (stop at whitespace)
  uniquify
* build org files
  Build trees from every uncontained node.
  Where they overlap, pick one ancestor
  at random to be the context.
  Once a context is fat (easiest measure: max # of nodes),
  remove it from the pool of containers.
