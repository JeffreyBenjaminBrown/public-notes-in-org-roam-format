#+title: right to feel, act on, and then {relax your grip on, forget}
* elaboration \ definition
Some things clearly are.

If more pains (broadly speaking -- fear, guilt, etc.) were like this, it seems like we would be both more functional and happier.
* the condition
  If, upon what one believes is sufficient examination, the memory does not usefully add to one's prior information -- in particular, it implies no changes to one's habits -- then forgetting is probably costless. Or near-forgetting, where one simply increments one's count of experiences like the one to be otherwise forgotten. (A single experience could in this way increment multiple counts, since it has multiple aspects.)
* I feared for my health, took a nap, feel good* now.
  i.e. health seems good now
