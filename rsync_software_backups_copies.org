#+title: rsync (software, backups & copies)
* PITFALL: trailing slash => unwrapped content

  If a source argument is a folder written with a trailing /,
  rsync will dump its contents into the destination,
  withouot wrapping them in a folder named like the source.
  For the same argument without the trailing /,
  rsync will create or populate a subfolder of the same name.
* PITFALL: the popular `delete` option is dangerous.
  It will delete anything in the destination not in the source.
  If there are multiple sources I don't know what it does.
* how I usually run it
  rsync -av source source ... source destination
  with [[id:0ec81667-d191-498a-b5d1-faadbd48e85d][no trailing slashes]] on any of the sources.
* useful options
** -L : replace symlinks with the original
   works as expected with -av
