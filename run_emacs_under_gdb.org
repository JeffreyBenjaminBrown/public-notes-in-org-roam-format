#+title: run Emacs under GDB
* TODO problem | ask
** When it crashed, I could not type anything into GDB. I had to run `pkill -f emacs`, whereupon GDB itself quit, so I could not ask for debugging information.
* how to do it
  In a shell, type
    gdb emacs
  Then in gdb, type
    run
* how to get debugging info once Emacs crashes
  Execute this in GDB (which will still be running):
    thread apply all bt
