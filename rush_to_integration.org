#+title: rush to integration
* definition-ish
** Get all you need for a working experience,
   before complicating any of the components.
** geometric metaphor
*** Like growing a tree in one dimension before the other.
* applies to coding
For instance, in SKG there is a server and a client. I tried to make the API handle more complexity than necessary when receiving the document from Emacs -- it would convey the cursor position, the folded state, maybe other stuff. That was unnecessary, and made closing the cycle difficult.

More generally, ask what the bare minimum necessary would be to get the app's parts to work together. Find a way to make that *extensible* in the later directions I want, but don't actually extend in those directions before integrating. Even if the app would be absolute garbage without a given feature, if the feature is not necessary for integration, leave it out until after integration works.
