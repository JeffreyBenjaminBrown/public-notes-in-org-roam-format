#+title: Salespeople suck. They *have to* suck.
* This includes people signing me up for a service,
  even if they didn't reach out to me.
* Their incentives are
  to overpromise, to downplay risks,
  to dismiss my concerns and
  reassure me without evidence that I don't have to worry,
  and to sound like they care about me
  until the contract is signed.
* A list of times this has happened.
** When Daniel at Claro signed me up for fiber optic internet.
   He assured me Thursday I could have it installed by Saturday,
   or Monday at the latest. I told him I flew out Thursday.
   It's Wednesday and they still haven't done it.
** When the climbing shoe store told me that my toe should be bent in a climbing shoe.
