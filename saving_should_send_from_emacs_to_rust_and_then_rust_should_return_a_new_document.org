#+title: saving should send from Emacs to Rust, and then Rust should return a new document
* why
  After saving, bullets that had no ID now have one.

  Rust would assign IDs to new headlines that lack them.
  Rust will need to know what lines are unfolded, and where point is, in order to restore that state.
