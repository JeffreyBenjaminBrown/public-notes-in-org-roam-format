#+title: Scaling People (book) by Claire Hughes Johnson
* "Time kills all deals."
* The ideal job-person fit unites love, impact and excellence.
  Excellence meaning it plays to (perhaps building)
  the person's strengths.
* A job ad should both encourage people who would be a good fit and discourage people who wouldn't.
