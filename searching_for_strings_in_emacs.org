#+title: searching for strings in Emacs
* search-forward string &optional limit noerror count
  Moves point to end of string, and returns position.
  If noerror is t, and the string is not found,
  search-forward returns nil and does nothing.
* search-backward string &optional limit noerror count
  is like search-forward, but looks backward,
  and leaves point at the *start* of the match.
