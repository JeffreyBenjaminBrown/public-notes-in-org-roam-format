#+title: searching in the shell
* [[id:c444f70b-f19a-417c-9064-1f5df4c3d803][shell tools for structured data]] (CSV, JSON, etc.)
* [[id:ee83ddd1-aeaa-46e9-a6a7-d180ac16471f][grep (command line search utility)]]
* find, show all file extensions in filetree
  find . -type f | sed 's/.*\.//' | grep -v "/" | sort | uniq -c
* find: exclude a type of file
  use the ! symbol to negate the next option
  for example, this:
    find . -type d ! -name "__pycache__"
  excludes anything called __pycache__
* `find -exec`: do something to every found result
** example: copy a file into every folder found
   find . -type d -exec cp __init__.py {} \;
* to find all numbers in code
  In tmux, run
    egrep "[0-9]+" -r build -r common -r draw -r regime *.py -C 5 --exclude="*test*"
  and then read that screen. (Dumping it to a file would mean losing the colors,
  which makes the reading process much slower.)
