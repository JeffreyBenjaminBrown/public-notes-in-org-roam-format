#+title: Second-order awareness seems to be enough.
Some meditation literature talks about being aware of one's awareness, and then being aware of that, etc. Or being aware of one's awareness of another's awareness of oneself, and then recursive cascades of that.

I'm sure all that's great, but it's also dautning, maybe discouragingly so. I suspect it's not worth targeting. Just go for being aware of (i.e. having) an experience while simultaneously being aware of one's awareness of it. That alone is an intensely a calming, mind-expanding exercise, very obviously worth it. Higher-order awareness yet will probably come with time, and does not need forcing.
