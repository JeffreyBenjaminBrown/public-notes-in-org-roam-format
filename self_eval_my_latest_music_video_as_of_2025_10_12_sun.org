#+title: self-eval : my latest music video as of <2025-10-12 Sun>
Unshared so far (<2025-10-12 Sun>).
Times correspond to the video,
  not the (original, at least) Reaper MIDI recording.
The notes were taken in serial.

   I stand up for a while at 5:30. Annoying.
     It's long; cut that head off.
* still too much harmony relative to rhythm
* rhythmic motifs too fast
* Has to be from the other side of the room.
* ambient around 15:30
  and great a minute or two thereafter
  it's like I chilled out, got perspective
* Maybe ask sometimes, what is the mood I am producing?
* Maybe never let completely go of the last theme.
  Or never seem to.
  If I do, remember it, and bring it back transformed,
  such that it was there the whole time.
* I like how it getes at 29:50 again
  or a bit before
* long melodic passages
* Individual bass notes can last longer.
* Trade off which finger is on the bass note for legato wanderings.
* There are many unexplored heights of speed, too.
  not just magnitutde but ways to use speed
