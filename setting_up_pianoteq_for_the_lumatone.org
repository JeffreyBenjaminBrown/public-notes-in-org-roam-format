#+title: setting up Pianoteq for the Lumatone
* defining a nonstandard EDO in Pianoteq
  In Tuning, select "multichannel <soething>".
  In the submenu from there,
  make sure the top thing has a checkmark next to it.
  Also put a checkmark next to "main MIDI channel". That can vary --
  Channel 1 makes it lower than Channel 2, etc.
  In Tuning also use "create EDO" to define, say, 31-edo.
  Use the snowflake icon to freeze the tuning,
  so that I can change the preset without having to redo the tuning.
* a "multichannel EDO" in Pianoteq interprets channel as octave
  This implies that there multiple messages can trigger the same note --
  for instance, in 31-edo, (Channel 0, Note 31) and (Channel 1, Note 0).
