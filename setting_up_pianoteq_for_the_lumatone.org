#+title: setting up Pianoteq for the Lumatone
In Tuning, select "multichannel <soething>".
In the submenu from there,
make sure the top thing has a checkmark next to it.
Also put a checkmark next to "main MIDI channel". That can vary --
Channel 1 makes it lower than Channel 2, etc.
In Tuning also use "create EDO" to define, say, 31-edo.
Use the snowflake icon to freeze the tuning,
so that I can change the preset without having to redo the tuning.
