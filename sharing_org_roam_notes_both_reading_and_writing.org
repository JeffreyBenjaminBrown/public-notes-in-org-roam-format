#+title: sharing org-roam notes , both reading and writing
* attaching judgments to notes
** representation
*** Each user could have a "considers [quality]" file, for various qualities.
    Each link in such a file would be one that the user has judged to have that quality.
    These files could get very long.
    The user could, if they want, organize them with plain text,
    but any link they included would be interpreted
    as another object of judgment.
*** Users should be able to provide justifications, context for their judgments.
    This implies perhaps making each judgment into its own file.
** Could only be (easily) applied to nodes, not plain text lines.
** Judging something should be easy.
   Having to remember the name of the file with the judgments, save a link, visit it and store the link might be cumbersome.
** A user should be notified when another judges or otherwise (effectively) writes about something of theirs.
* Diffs, esp. of pull requests, should be readable.
  This suggests [[id:54cd30f3-b696-4017-a02e-4e5b17ab1553][leaving the org-roam format]].
* Sharing write permissions to a file seems hard.
