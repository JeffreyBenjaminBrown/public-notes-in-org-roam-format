#+title: shave, how to
serial
* exfoliate
  at least if not using badger hair
* get skin hot
  I got mixed signals about this -- maybe first get it hot but then cool it down a little, so it's soft but not too soft.
* use a pre-shave oil
* apply shave cream

  (after pre-shave oil) with a wet [[id:8f4026da-4429-4120-9b87-004eb8cc79cc][shaving brush]].
  This exfoliates.
* three passes
  with grain, across grain, against grain
* Aftershave is to close pores and moisturize.
  "Feels good".
