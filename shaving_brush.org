#+title: shaving brush
* animal welfare
  Badger and boar's hair brushes require killing the animal.
  Horse hair brushes do not. (Neither, of course, do synthetic ones.)
* how they compare
** boar's hair is stiffest
** badger's hair is softest
   It also comes in different flavors, "silvertip" being the softest.
** horse hair is somewhere between
* area matters
  A nice brush with a small area will take a long time to cover the face.
