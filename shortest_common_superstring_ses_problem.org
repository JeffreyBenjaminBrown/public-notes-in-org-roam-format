#+title: Shortest Common Superstring Problem (bioinformatics)
a.k.a. SES problem
= Given a set S of strings, find SCS(S), the shortest string containing them.
* The SES problem is NP-complete.
* The greedy solution
is fast but imperfect.
** Collapse the graph.
Find the biggest edge (overlap).
If there are multiple, choose at random.
Merge those two nodes by concatenating them around their overlap.
Recompute the new node's edges.
Repeat until the graph has one node.
