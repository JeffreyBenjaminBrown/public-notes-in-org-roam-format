#+title: show number and kind of upstream nodes
* three things to count
** containers, if multiple
   exclude the current org-predecessors
** links
** subscriptions
   unsubscriptions seem irrelevant
* display the counts in "CSV" format
  so if only the third is present,
  the "three" numbers would read ",,x"
