#+title: skg : cloning seems unnecessary
* definition
** cloning involves recursive subscription
   One can clone someone else's docuemnt, or part of it.
   Suppose one clones D.
   This creates a node D' in one's graph, subscribed to D,
   whose initial contents are clones of the contents of D.
* two differences between cloning and mere subscription
** it's recursive
** a clone has initial contents; a pure subscriber does not
* TODO How do cloning and links interact?
  If author A links in document D from N to M (also in D),
  and author A' clones D to D',
  should the clone M' of M link to N, or to its clone N'?
* TODO How to cloning and comments interact?
