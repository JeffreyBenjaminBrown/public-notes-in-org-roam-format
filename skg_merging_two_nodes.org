#+title: skg : merging two nodes
* the idea
The result has all the content of both nodes,
and both IDs.
Links to either node now go to the merged node.
Merging is flat and simple -- reordering content,
or merging content within the merged notes
(potentially at different levels)
can only be done manually.
* TODO What if one or both are foreign?
