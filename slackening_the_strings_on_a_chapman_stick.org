#+title: slackening the strings on a Chapman Stick
* how
** Don't
   try to slacken any string completely on the first go.
** Instead
   slacken all of them a bit, then slacken all of them some more, etc.
* why
  That way no single string is left bearing tons of tension while the others are slackened.
