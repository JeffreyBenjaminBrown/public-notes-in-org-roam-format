* TODO rebuild docker image with iproute2
Dockerfile is already modified (but not committed) for that.
* TODO get metadata working too
It should include list-of-repositoroies.txt.
I should move files on each cycle so that it includes activity.log.
* TODO clean SmSn for others
** update docker-smsn repo
** update docker image(s)
** document how to [[id:ba1a3e6f-0407-4004-8aa0-7333b0673b42][build the Dockerfile]]
* TODO change smsn
** the RH column should be on the left instead
because in a long list of short items it's hard to see how they line up with the RH
* smsn / how to do stuff

**** build the .jar natively, copy it to docker-smsn
  Run this from the root folder of the smsn/ code:
    gradle :smsn-server:shadowJar
  Somehwere, that will build a file that matches this regex:
    smsn-server-*-all.jar
  Copy that to be a sibling of the Dockerfile.
*** launch SmSn
**** sequentially
***** docker run
      docker run -it --name smsn \

**** The move mode command is "s".
**** How I fixed it
 (It wasn't working for a while.)
 It started working once I fixed smsn.yaml and updated smsn-mode.

*** Where did my songs go?
    Grep for "slick fish",
    grep for "demographic miracle work" (doubtful)
    I remember some of them somewhat
      slick fish, miracle work
    they might be in "whole songs" in "qq music"
