#+title: smsn todo
* TODO rebuild docker image with iproute2
Dockerfile is already modified (but not committed) for that.
* TODO get metadata working too
It should include list-of-repositoroies.txt.
I should move files on each cycle so that it includes activity.log.
* TODO clean SmSn for others
** update docker-smsn repo
** update docker image(s)
** document how to [[id:ba1a3e6f-0407-4004-8aa0-7333b0673b42][build the Dockerfile]]
* TODO change smsn
** the RH column should be on the left instead
because in a long list of short items it's hard to see how they line up with the RH
