https://dynomight.net/2020/09/29/doing-discourse-better-stuff-i-wish-i-knew/
* some new ways to organize fora
** Let users edit each other's writing.
** Easy conversation graph visualization, navigation.
** Curated views of a conversation.
** Allow users to sign up for the content they wish they enjoyed?
   "Ulysses nudge"
** Combine fora and prediction markets.
* good things distinguishing journals from fora
** Heavy focus on attribution.
** Quality signals and heavy moderation.
   "In most fields there is a fairly clear status hierarchy. The moderators (reviewers/editors) at top journals spend a lot of effort moderating, and are very picky about what they accept. This provides strong signaling for the papers that are accepted."
** External incentives to publish in top journals.
