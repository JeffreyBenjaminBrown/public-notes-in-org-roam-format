* TODO RESUME
  at first instance of the phrase:
    you can probably find employers that will waste less of your time.
* "[bullshit is] the junk food of experience"
  "addictive but unrewarding pastimes."
  "Unnecessary meetings"
  "it's either forced on you, or it tricks you."
** [jbb] Awareness ought to solve this.
   Ask frequently whether something is necessary and/or rewarding,
   and adjust behavior accordingly.
