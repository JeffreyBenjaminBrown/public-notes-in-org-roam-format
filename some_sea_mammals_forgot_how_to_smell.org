#+title: Some sea mammals forgot how to smell.
* sources
** The gist comes from Your Inner Fish by Neil Shubin.

   I remembered the gist but these details are from ChatGPT,
   mostly verbatim outside of the headlines,
   and extending somewhat beyond what the book said.
* the facts, I hope
** It depends on whether they ever return to land.
Other aquatic mammals, such as seals and sea lions, retain some olfactory abilities because they still come ashore and have a more direct connection between their noses and the brain.

Cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises), however, have evolved to be fully aquatic and have no use for a sense of smell in their daily lives.
** cetacions
Dolphins' ancestors, when adapting to aquatic life, experienced a gradual degeneration of the olfactory system, resulting in:

- The loss of olfactory nerves (which are responsible for transmitting smell signals to the brain).
- The disappearance of olfactory bulbs, which are key brain structures that process smell.

The dolphinâ€™s blowhole is designed for efficient breathing, not olfaction.

- It features a specialized muscular flap that tightly seals the blowhole to prevent water entry while swimming.
- Air passes through quickly and does not interact with any sensory tissue that could detect odor molecules.

Unlike land animals, dolphins cannot inhale through their mouths, which further limits any potential alternate pathway for smell detection.
