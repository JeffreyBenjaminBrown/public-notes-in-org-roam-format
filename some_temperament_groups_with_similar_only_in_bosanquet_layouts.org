#+title: some temperament groups with similar (only in Bosanquet?) layouts
* PITFALL: On further clarification
  this seems only to apply to "fifths-based temperament families".
  I don't think of EDOs that way, and don't want to.

* the list
** Flattone, 33&19: 691-695c (40 was actually a bit outside this range, so you would have to use 40d)
** Septimal meantone, 19&43: 695-697c
** 5-limit meantone, 26&12: 693-700c
** Schismatic in the big sense, 12&29: 700-703c or so, with most optimal stuff more like 65&41: 701.5-702.5c
** Leapfrog, 29&17: 703-706c or so
** Inverse gentle, 17&22: 706-709c or so
** Archy, 17&37: 706-712c or so
** Superpyth, 22&27: 709-711c optimal range, though one can extend slightly for worse approximations
