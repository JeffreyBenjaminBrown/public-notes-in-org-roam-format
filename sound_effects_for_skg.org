#+title: sound effects for skg
* elaboration | definition
  The user could "make their own game",
  assign sound effects to different graph events.
* example events, all social
** someone did something* with your node
*** referenced
*** subscribed
*** described
*** asked about
*** used as a realtionship
** The sound effect could also depend on how subscribed-to the place they did that is.
   and recursively -- a calculation comparable to pagerank
* ? Could similar events be enjoyably defined for one's own notes?
  Is there an algorithm for thinking in a graph?
