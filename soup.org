#+title: soup
* TODO soak strategy
  1 hot
  2 rinses
  1 25% vinegar
  2 rinses
  1 plain water
  1 rinse
* TODO SHELL THE BEANS during soaking.
  Today I've had two bowls and no gas.
  After each soak, mush them around with my hands to get more shells off, and then pour off the water until just before beans start coming out (the shells float).
* 2 big cups of beans seems about right
* ingredients
** 2 ajis, picados en pedazos muy pequeños
** 1 o 2 zanahoria (1 si es grande)
** 1 cebolla
** 2 tomates
** 2 tallos de apio
** 2 papas
* Everything boils slower in Bogotá.
* Carrots take a long time to soften.
  At least in Bogotá.
  After 40 minutes they were still hard-ish.
* Small potatoes supposedly take 15-20 minutes.
* Add olive oil to each bowl separately.
  Boiling reduces its polyphenol content,
  and polyphenols are great.
