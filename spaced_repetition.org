*** The special international status of the US dollar is not important to the US.

**** maybe the biggest benefit
     The dollars held outside the US do represent a 0-interest loan, which in times of high interest rates can be meaningful -- about 0.25% of GDP.
**** some non-existent benefits
***** The US current account deficit is less than Britain's or Australia's.
***** The US borrows at a higher interest rate than Britain or Japan.
***** The British pound, which was only overtaken by the US dollar in 1955 and not special at all by 1975, has only increased in value against the dollar since.
*** Countries might not give the widest coverage as units of news analysis.
    There's something repetitive about "this country's got a tyrant ... and this other country's got a tyrant ... and here's what the tyrant over there's doing ..."
