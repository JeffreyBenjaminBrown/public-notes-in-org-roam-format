#+title: stablecoin (cryptocurrency)
* some vocab
** on-ramps and off-ramps
   Exchanges where one trades fiat for crypto, or vice-versa.
* fiat-backed stablecoins
** what it is
   The issuer keeps e.g. dollars in reserve,
   and can issue exactly one crypto token per dollar
   (or some other but fixed ratio).
** examples
   [[id:59ed8cc2-5fdd-40d3-91df-b5ce4d740465][Gemini Dollar (GUSD)]]
   Tether (USDT)
   True USD (TUSD)
   Paxos Standard (PAX)
** requires a trusted central authority
   which holds the fiat collateral off-chain.
** Anything on Ethereum faces high gas fees.
   In 2021 they ranged from 2 to 60 USD.
* crypo-collateralized stablecoins
** example: [[id:5707db6c-82e4-41d1-91a1-bf6e804756c3][DAI]]
** Collateral is locked into a smart contract
   and unlocked when the stablecoin is returned.
** Coins minted *or* borrowed with the same kind of collateral.
** Holders are in a "collateralized debt position" (CDP).
** If the value of the collateral drops far enough, some is sold.
*** TODO How much?
    I'm guessing enough to bring them,
    not above-water, but at-water.
* algorithmic stablecoins
  hold no collateral, are ridiculous.
