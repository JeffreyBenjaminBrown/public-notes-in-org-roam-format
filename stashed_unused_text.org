* data vs. metadata, and provenance queries
  In traditional data structures there is a sharp distinction between data and metadata. What an author said is data; who they are, when they said it, and who they cited are metadata. In the hypergraph database, there is no such distinction. As a result, it is easy to mix questions about provenance and questions about content in the same query.
