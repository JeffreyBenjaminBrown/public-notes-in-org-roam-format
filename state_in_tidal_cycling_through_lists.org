#+title: state in Tidal: cycle through a list whenever the note changes
* ref
  https://tidalcycles.org/docs/reference/state_values
* the idea
  The new `VState` constructor for `Value``,
  rather than holding a static `Value`,
  holds an update function.
  It can thus cycle through a (maybe infinite) list,
  which seems to be the major use case.
* What's novel about it
  Normally, when you cycle through a list,
  phase in the cycle depends only on time.
  Here it is independent of time;
  it depends only on the most recent value played.
* PITFALL: These state cycles must take their "structure" from another pattern.
  For instance, in
    sound "alphabet(5,8)" # nTake "bob" [0 .. 4]
  the timing depends on "alphabet(5,8)".
  At each new note from that pattern,
  "bob" picks a new value from the cycle [0..4].
* some important function
  nTake, freqTake, setF, nCountTo
* also supposedly relevant: bite, fit, ur
