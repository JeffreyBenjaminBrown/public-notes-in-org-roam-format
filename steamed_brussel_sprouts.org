#+title: steamed brussel sprouts
Add nothing.
Use an ordinary pot with a lid.
Put a little water, not nearly enough to cover a sprout, just enough to make steam.
Boil that water on maximum-low for maybe five minutes, ten, 15, who cares.
Stop the heat and leave them there a while longer.
Probably five minutes of boiling and fifteen minutes steeping in the steam is enough.
