#+title: Study your pains.
* Sometimes, probably, it is most helpful to dwell on the pain.
* It seems a real, irrational impulse to be averse to it.
  I seem to have an impulse to give up on experiences I find painful, which has sometimes proven a shockingly bad idea after I though hard about them.

** Seeking pain for the sake of study is, of course, dumb.
** Some painful things can and should be avoided, and need not be analyzed beyond that.
