  serial, in scide
** This probably is not required.
   Set `ugenPluginsPath` [[id:b45a1d6d-3cef-472e-9c4f-44b8296bd17e][as required by my strange NixOS setup]].

* Dirt samples
** samples I like
*** bend - crackling percussion
*** hh:1 - a light crash
*** voodoo 0 : deep carboy sound
*** voodoo 3 : shakey sound
*** voodoo 4 : high carboy sound
*** wind : moogish wind sound
    mostly rising in pitch as sample index rises
** figuring out durations
*** "bev" is 16 seconds long
** TODO samples I need
   ride cymbal
   crash cymbal
* TODO parameters that have no effect

** I can't use "accelerate" in any of the synths so far.
** I can't use "muffle" in superpiano
   even though I added "muffle" to the parameters in "bin/generate-params.hs" and regenerated them
* synths
** PITFALL: Some parameters aren't described in the docs for some synths.
   e.g. "decay" applies to supersquare but they don't say that.
** the synths
*** supergong
    Pitchless below around 200 Hz.
**** "voice" [0,4-ish] : high => weird and long notes
     It can be any nonnegative number.
**** "decay" [0,2-ish] is like palm-muting.
     Any nonnegative number.
**** Low notes are long and kind of pitchless.
*** supersquare
**** "voice" = pulse width.
     Useful range around [0.005, 0.5] (that's a half-open interval).
     0.005 is very quiet.
**** "semitone" = second oscillator's displacement
**** "resonance" = filter resonance.
     Maybe [0,0.8]
     Makes a squealy sound.
     The high end is stupid.
**** "lfo" : how much the LFO affects the filter frequency
     Negative values are fun, have a muted swirling effect.
     The useful range is at least [-1,1]
**** "rate" : lfo rate
     If it's in audible pitch territory it creates FM.
**** TODO "pitch1" : filter frequency scaling multiplier
     Useful range [0.1,4].
     Values near 0 are wonderful, ghostly.
     Values above 2 are very crunchy, buzzy.
*** supersaw
**** TODO "voice" is *crazy*
     Controls "relative phase and detune amount".
     Range [0,400].
     At 0 it's a very pure sound.
     Near 0 it's phasey and with an attack (?).
     Around 0.5 it's that classic mismatched saw thing.
     Around 3 it's in an uncanny valley.
     From 5 to 40 or so it gives thick undertones.
     For round values higher than 40 it's kind of glassy,
     and for non-round ones (e.g. 201) it's out of phase but well-behaved.
**** TODO "[[id:4c184094-bd63-4bc1-a4a1-c6dfcbd35697][decay]]" is useful
     supersaw tends to be very buzzy.
     A "decay" value of 0.8 or higher makes it pretty tame.
**** "semitone"
     0.05 rounds the sound out.
     7.02 sounds like a separate voice, b/c it is.
     Next-harmonic intervals are nice too -- e.g. 16.86.
**** TODO "lfo" : negative is fun!
     -1 gives it ia poppy attack.
     -3 gives it a violin-ish swell
     -30 freaks out (but not loud).
**** pitch1: low values calm it down
     useful range [0.01, 2]
*** superpwm
**** "voice" : phase shift rate
     Useful range maybe [0.1,50].
       0 itself is quiet but otherwise not much different from 0.1.
     Below 0.4, very pure.
     Around 3, sounds detuned.
     10 and above : alien, inharmonic.
*** superchip : weird!
**** PITFALL: "hz" seems to conflict with "slide"
     But when slide=0, hz comes through.
**** "slide" : creates a "linear frequency glide"
     From where to where?
**** "rate" : repeats the glide that many times
     Can be negative, fractionalo
**** "pitch2" and "pitch3": relative frequencies of oscillators 2 and 3
*** superhoover: basically just one sound, but cool
**** "hz" as normal
**** "slide" controls how each pitch is entered
     negative values => slide down into it.
**** "decay" is the usual
*** superzow: tuned saws, simple
**** slide
     Useful range [1,300] logarithmic.
     More = calmer, less = buzzy.
**** decay: normal
**** detune: [0,100]
     1 doesn't sound weird. 3 does.
     But 100 it just sounds like an octave.
     Above 100 it's stupid.
*** superpiano
**** PITFALL: velocity: too sensitive
     [0.5,  0.8] is a useful range.
     At 1 it's loud but tinny.
     Below 0.5 it sounds good but too quiet; needs an amp boost.
**** PITFALL : sustain: pitch mismatch
     A short value can make sense for high notes yet sound totally wrong for low ones.
**** sustain range -- extreme values are trippy
     0.01 is mellow and very brief.
     0.1 has the duration of notes in a jazz solo.
     5 is about the top of the "reasonable" range.
     Around 15 the starts of the notes get blurry.
*** DONE supertron: meh
    more detuned whatevers
** some common params
*** TODO "decay" near 0 is little effect, near 1 is very staccato

    :END:
    Useful range [0,1].
    Above 1 it seems to reflect -- 1.1 = 0.9, etc.
