** Within ten or so it would kill us outright.
** But within 500 it would strip the Earth of its magnetosphere.
* None of the stars close enough to kill us if they went supernova are big enough to go supernova.
* A few supernovae have been visible to the naked eye.
** In 1054 one created the Crab Nebula.
** In 1604 one made a star visible by daylight for three weeks.
* Carbon and heavier things need supernovae to form.
  Even the cores of regular stars aren't hot enough.
