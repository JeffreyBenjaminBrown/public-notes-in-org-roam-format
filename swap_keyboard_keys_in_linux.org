#+title: swap keyboard keys in Linux
e.g. swap ESC and CapsLock
* TODO I'm currently using two different methods.
  I swap ESC and CapsLock via KDE, hence only in KDE,
  but I map the other should-be-Super key to Super via Xmodmap.
* using`xev` and `Xmodmap`
** use `xev` to find the keycode a key emits
   On NixOS that's installed via the `xorg.xev` package.
** write (what I'm calling) a key-remapping command
   I don't know what grammar that's in,
   but here's an example of such a command:
     keycode 135 = Super_R
** put that command in ~/.Xmodmap
** be sure `xmodmap` is installed
   in NixOS, it's in the `xorg.xmodmap` package
* using KDE
  It's in Settings somewhere.
* a guide, which might not describe any of the methods in this file
