#+title: systematic socializing
* [[id:30478629-506c-4acf-aec8-b74e977a2234][Keep, and know when to read and modify, files on people]].
* planning
** Know what I'm getting into before accepting an invitation.
   e.g. when invited to a video call,
   know who else is invited -- journalists? politicians?
* outreach
** Implement spaced repetition for outreach.
*** both for people I know and people I'd like to
** Don't get discouraged by a failure fraction.
   It's natural that not everyone has the time, imagination, or fit (with my interests) to sustain an interesting conversation. If I never run into disinterest I'm not reaching out enough. And if I do it doesn't mean they dislike me; they're probably flattered and|or wish they could take the opportunity.
* conversation
** Ask people about their life stories, decisions
*** Normally they talk about the recent.
