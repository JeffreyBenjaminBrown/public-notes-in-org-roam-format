Hypothetical.
* [[id:30478629-506c-4acf-aec8-b74e977a2234][Keep files on people]]
* review those notes before meeting
* Implement spaced repetition for outreach.
** both for people I know and people I'd like to
* Don't get discouraged by a failure fraction.
  It's natural that not everyone has the time, imagination, or fit (with my interests) to sustain an interesting conversation. If I never run into disinterest I'm not reaching out enough. And if I do it doesn't mean they dislike me; they're probably flattered and|or wish they could take the opportunity.
