** Know what I'm getting into before accepting an invitation.
   e.g. when invited to a video call,

** Don't get discouraged by a failure fraction.
   It's natural that not everyone has the time, imagination, or fit (with my interests) to sustain an interesting conversation. If I never run into disinterest I'm not reaching out enough. And if I do it doesn't mean they dislike me; they're probably flattered and|or wish they could take the opportunity.
