#+title: Thanos tunings
* TODO PITFALL: largely extracted
  I moved (most? all?) of my favorites to  [[id:80068e27-a77e-4d73-b762-235ec2cc6de4][some edos (equal divisions of the octave)]].
* TODO put this in SmSn
  It's very graph -- the relationships between scales, the different ways to categorize tunings (by EDO, by layout) ...
* two I posted to Microtonal Guitarists
* code to see how harmonics fall across equally spaced strings
  This shows what happens if, after skipping 7 strings, you land back at the octave. (So you could play the octave on open strings of an 8-string guitar.)
> myPrint $ map ((*7) . (/ log 2) . log) [3/2,5/4,7/4,11/8,13/8 :: Float] -- ,17/16,19/16]
  I believe I could do the above for non-integer values of 7.
* TODO good-looking edos per my weighted absolute errors code
  PITFALL: does not take into account interactions between the errors,
    which depend on sign
  99, 94, 89, 87, 84, 77, 72, 65, 63, 58, 53, 46, 41
* what Matthew Autry uses
  "For both 72edo and 87edo, I use every third fret-24 and 29 frets to the octave. I don't use isomorphic tunings. I use seven string acoustic guitars, which gives about an octave in one position. Open string tuning, low to high-1/1,10/9,6/5,4/3,40/27,8/5,16/9."
* my favorite tunings
** What I tried
   Here I'm trying by hand: everything starting from 46, for every modululs m such that edo / m >= 12, for spacing from too small to get a full octave on a guitar until I'm at least into the 20s and looking at jumps of greater than 400 cents. Only trying edos with good-looking harmonics.
** [[id:4c460fd0-bab5-416a-a83e-e3f2eab1f218][105-Edo]]
** 50 3 10: octave (5,0), only 13, 19 and 31 hard to reach
** 67 2 13: 2 at (5,1), great for 7-limit, plus more goodies
** TODO 67 3 11: 2 at (5,4), *fantastic* for 19-limit +31 -7
   67d is much more playable, putting 7 at 4,1 instead of at 3,7,
     with an error of 16c instead of -2c.
   Unfortunately the flat 3:1 plays badly with the sharp everything else.
** TODO 67 3 13: 2 at (4,5), span of 7 for everything in 31-limit -19
   The fret for every prime except 19 is in [0,7],
   so like prime approximation errors, they cancel in fractions.
** 67 3 15: 2 at (5,-1), span of 8 in 31-limit -23
** 68 4 13: 2 at (4,4), span of 3 in the 13-limit -2 -7 +19 +31
   Omitting the octave from that set of primes is a deal-killer though.
** 72 3 13: 2 at (6,-2), span of 5 in the 31-limit -19 -23 -13
** 72 3 14: 2 at (6,-4), span of 7 in the 29-limit -19 -23
** 72 3 19: 2 at (4,-1), great for 3.5.13.23.31
** 72 4 23: 2 at (4,-5), span of 6 for 3.5.7.13.23.31
   Prime 2 extends it by 3 frets.
   Prime 29 extends it by 1 more.
** 74 2 13: 2 at 6:-2, span of 6 in the 31-limit -19
** 74 5 14: 2 at 6:-2, span of 6 in the 31-limit -29 -23, nice 1st-pos triads
   They don't play great with the octave, though -- can lead to a reach of 5 frets, which is about 4 frets of 12-edo.
** TODO 77 3 17: 2 at 4:3, fret span 10 in 31-limit -17 -19, great triads if it weren't for the octave
   Skip primes 11 and 29 to save 3 more frets.
** 77 3 20: okay triads, 2 at 4:-1, span of 6 for 13-limit -11 +23
   and for another 2 frets, include prime 29
** TODO 80 4 17: 2 at 4:3, great range, perfect triads, confusing
fret span of 5 over 2:3:5
80 steps = 2 % 1:   str  4 fret 3
47 steps = 3 % 2:   str  3 fret -1

add 23 and 31 for free:
42 steps = 23 % 16: str  2 fret 2
76 steps = 31 % 16: str  4 fret 2

add 13 for one more fret:
56 steps = 13 % 8:  str  4 fret -3

add these to bump fret span to 11
65 steps = 7 % 4:   str  5 fret -5 (and "bad" error of 6c)
37 steps = 11 % 8:  str  1 fret 5
 7 steps = 17 % 16: str -1 fret 6
20 steps = 19 % 16: str  0 fret 5
69 steps = 29 % 16: str  5 fret -4
** 80 5 11: fret range of 7 in 31-limit -17, okay triads
* What beats 87?
** In terms of harmonic series approximation
130, 140, 161, 171, 181, 183, 193, 202, 217, 224

*** 118 miracle v. 87 miracle
**** fewer frets in 118
118 3 23 => only 39+1/3 frets, vs.
87 2 17 => 43.5 frets
**** easier to play in 87
lim7 span of 4 in 87, 6 in 118

*** TODO 104 % 5 rivals Kite's tuning
But as he points out, there are at most 2 places on the neck where you can play in any given scale.
20.8 fpo
5/4 is 5.5 cents flat; everything else is perfect.
**** 104 5 33: *3.8\12 string gap*, max reach 11 but 4 in the 11-limit.
104/5 => 20.8 edo, so that 11-fret gap really is harder than Kite's 8.
Almost exactly the Kite layout,
except 13/8 is in a weird place -- (1,8) rather than (3,-5).
**** 104 5 28: 3.2\12 string gap, max reach 9 but 4 in the 11-limit.
*** TODO 58-edo: beats Kite for guitar if 3.1\12 string gaps are acceptable
**** TODO 58 2 15: *max reach of 3 ignoring 11/8*, *3.1\12 per gap*
max reach of 8 including 11/8 -- but 8\29 is shorter than the
8\29 max reach of Kite's tuning
**** TODO 58 3 13: max reach of 7 (4 ignoring 11/8), 2.7\12 string gaps
**** TODO 58 6 13: 9+2/3 fpo, 2.7\12 gaps, *13-lim reach of 5*
and the layout is nice too!
**** 58 *7* 13: *max reach of 5*, 8+2/7-edo
Layout would be nice if pitch rose away from me on the monome.
**** 58's miracle layout is nearly dominated by 104
It wins on span -- 7 frets of 19.3-edo vs. 9 frets of 20.8-edo --
but in the 11-limit 104 totally dominates it.
**** 58 2 14: max reach of 7, 2.9\12 string gap, but awkward layout
*** TODO 63 rivals 41
It wins harmonically: the 3/2 is slightly worse, everything else better.
**** TODO 63 3 20: best for guitar? *3.8\12 gaps*, layout nearly 41 2 13
11-limit max reach of 6
but max reach of 11 in 13-limit, v. Kite's 8
**** 63 2 13: 2.5\12 gaps, 31.5-fpo, *13-lim span of 7*
**** 63 *12* 17: 5.25-edo, 3.2\12 gaps, *13-lim reach 5 frets*
They're five giant frets, but it'll work on the monome!
**** 63 7 12: best for monome? 9 fpo, 2.29\12 gaps, *13-lim max reach of 5*
**** 63 2 11: 13-lim reach of 6, close to miracle layout
very slightly narrower gaps: octave on string 5 fret 4.
7/4 and 11/8 are a bit less convenient.
**** 63 3 17: *3.2\12 gaps*, *11-lim max reach of 4*
and 13-limit max reach of 9 -- equal to 41 2 13
*** TODO 115 11 26: 10.45 fpo, 2.7\12 gaps, *lim7 range 2*
lim13 range 12, but drops to 6 if you ignore 11/8, or 8 if you ignore 13/8
*** TODO 53
**** 53 *17* 12: 2.7\12 gaps, *lim13 reach 6*, *3.1 fpo*
**** 53 *5* 12: 2.7\12 string gap, *lim11 reach 2*, *10.6-edo*
**** 53 3 10: 17+2/3 fpo, *lim13 reach 4*, very nearly miracle
octave is at (5,1) like normal, but fifths are at (4,-3)
**** 53 7 10: 7.5 fpo, *lim13 reach 4*
Perfect octave is at (6,-1), but the frets are big; it's very nearly miracle.
**** 53 2 11: 2.5\12 gaps, *lim13 max reach of 6\26.5*
Slightly wider string gaps than miracle; octave at (5,-1).
*** TODO 133: *awesome*, but 44+(1/3)-edo frets
**** 133 3 29: awesome
2.6\12 between strings
*13-limit span of 7*
**** 133 3 26: miracle layout
     Literally identical 31-limit layout to 87 2 17.
     Harmonically better than 87 for harmonics 17 and 23 (and some other harmonics unreachable in this layout).
*** TODO 104 5 28: rivals 41 2 13
3.2\12 between strings
*11-limit span of 4*
 13-limit +29.31 span of 9
*** 128
128 / 3 => 42.333 fpo
**** 128 3 25: miracle, very close to 87
very slightly fewer frets than 87 2 miracle
slightly worse sound
**** 128 3 28: 7-span 5, 13-span 7, 2.6\12 gaps
*** TODO 46
**** 46 3 11:
 Good: the 13-limit fret span is 6.
 Bad: 7/4 and 5/4 both require a reach of 6 frets.
 Good: 2.9 between strings.
 Bad: Octaves span 5 strings (base 0).
**** 46 5 9: 9.2-edo frets, 2.34\12 gaps, *span of 3 excluding 11/8*
13-lim span of 6
**** 46 2 11:
 Good: Same 2.9\12 between strings.
 Good: span of 8 frets, 6 in the 7-limit, and every prime under 8 requires a reach of 3 or less.
**** 46 2 13: 3.4 bewteen strings. span of 10, nicer than it seems.
 3/2 requires a reach of either 7 frets positive or 6 frets negative,
   but that actually makes it more flexible.
 The other intervals are all pretty small.
*** 118: great but needs really small string gaps
(mod 4 or 7) skip 19: span of 7, 1.9\12 bewteen strings
118 also offers a miracle alignment very much like 87.
*** TODO 41
**** TODO 41 2 11: seems better than Kite's
     Octave at 3,4.
     Primes span 7 frets in the 31-limit,
       or 5 frets excluding 13,
       or 4 frets excluding also 19 and 23.
**** 41 8 11: *13-lim range 5 frets* *octave at (3,1)*
     great for monome
**** 41 3 11: 3.2\12 gap, *13-lim span 5*
*** 67-edo
good but thirds are 7.7c sharp
**** 67 3 14: 22+1/3 fpo, 2.5\12 gaps, *13-lim span 7*
**** 67 2 13: miracle, 33.5-edo frets
*** not 56 -- its 3/2 is > 5 cents sharp
*** not 68 -- dominated by 104, and 3/2 is a 7-fret reach
*** not 50 -- bad sound (3/2 is 6 cents flat)
*** not 68 -- the fifth is too far away
** narrower tunings
*** TODO 96
96 9 20: 10.666 fpo, 2.5\12 gaps, span of 8 (or 5 ignoring 11/8)
96 3 17: spaced 2.1\12, span of 8 frets, 5-limit span 4 frets
*** TODO 166 7 30: reach of 4 in 11-limit, 2.1\12 between strings
reach of 10 in 13-limit
*** TODO 111 7 18: reach of 6 in 11-limit, 1.9\12 between strings
almost dominated by 166, except this has
reach of 9 in the 13-limit
*** 99 3 16: reach of 3 in 11-limit, 1.94\12 between strings
*** 130 4 21: reach of 7 in 11-limit, 1.93\12 between strings
*** 118, 94 close-spaced both give nice narrow ranges
    but they're awkwardly arranged.
*** 94
**** 94 7 23: *13.43-edo*, *2.9\12 gaps*, *great sound*
but harder to play than 41-edo: the max reach is 8\13.5 rather than 8\20.5
**** 94 7 18: string gap 2.3]12, span of 7 frets, but awkward
**** 94 4 17 is great for 11-limit
     max fret reach of 4 (but 10 in the 13-limit).
** individual tunings
*** not 74: 3/2 is 4.7 cents flat
*** not 78: 3/2 is 5.7 cents sharp
*** 103
*** 130 4 19, span 13, 7-limit span of 3, spaced 1.9\12
*** 46 is very worthy
*** 87 is incredible, with various good spacings (2,3,5)
    87 / 3, spaced 17\87 looks best.
    But this one's also good: thanosreport 87 3 14
