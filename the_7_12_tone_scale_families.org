#+title: the tiny number (33) of important scales for 12-tone harmony
* why this is good news
  Many people seem to think the theory of harmony is hard
  because there are "so many scales".
  But if you can memorize 33 phone numbers,
  you can memorize all the important scales.
* How can I make such an absolutist claim?
  See the last section of this document for a precise description
  of the space that this list characterizes.

  I'm not trying to impose a value judgment --
  or rather, it's not a value judgment that I came up with.
  These are the most important scales in the sense that
  you really have to look hard to find
  music with harmonies outside of these scales.
* what I mean by "scale family"
  A scale family is a set of scales equal modulo transposition.
  For instance,
  the major scale is equal to the minor scale modulo transposition,
  because if you start on the 6th degree of the major scale,
  you get a minor scale.
* the 7 scale families
  I'm writing these as chromatic formulae rather than using music notation. Music notation is excellent for communicating rhythm and pitch in a small space, but not great for revealing mathematical relationships among scales.

  So, for instance, where I write `0 2 3 5 7 9 10`,
  if you prefer you can read `C D Eb F G A Bb`,
  or any number of other equivalent expressions.
** The 7 scales of the major scale family, in order
*** ionian = "major"
    0 2 4 5 7 9 11
*** dorian
    Start on the 2nd degree of ionian and you get this.

    0 2 3 5 7 9 10
*** phrygian
    Start on the 2nd degree of dorian
    (or the 3rd degree of ionian, etc.)
    and you get this.

    0 2 3 5 7 9 10
*** lydian
    I'll stop spelling it out,
    but the pattern continues.

    0 2 4 6 7 9 11
*** mixolydian
    0 2 4 5 7 9 10
*** aeolian = "minor"
    0 2 3 5 7 8 10
*** locrian
    0 1 3 5 6 8 10
** The 7 scales of the melodic minor scale family, in order
*** dorian #7 = ionian b3 = "melodic minor"
    0 2 3 5 7 9 11
*** phrygian #6 = dorian b2
    0 1 3 5 7 9 10
*** lydian #5 = [no corresponding flat name]
    0 2 4 6 8 9 11
*** mixolydian #4 = lydian b7
    0 2 4 6 7 9 10
*** aeolian #3 = mixolydian b6
    0 2 4 5 7 8 10
*** locrian #2 = aeolian b5
    0 2 3 5 6 8 10
*** [no corresponding sharp name] = locrian b4
    0 1 3 4 6 8 10
** The 7 scales of the harmonic minor scale family, in order
*** aeolian #7 = "harmonic minor"
    0 2 3 5 7 8 11
*** locrian #6
    0 1 3 5 6 9 10
*** ionian #5
    0 2 4 5 8 9 11
*** dorian #4
    0 2 3 6 7 9 10
*** phrygian #3
    0 1 4 5 7 8 10
*** lydian #2
    0 3 4 6 7 9 11
*** locrian b4 b7
    0 1 3 4 6 8 9
** The 7 scales of the harmonic major scale family, in order
*** ionian b6 = "harmonic major"
    0 2 4 5 7 8 11
*** dorian b5
    0 2 3 5 6 9 10
*** phrygian b4
    0 1 3 4 7 8 10
*** lydian b3
    0 2 3 6 7 9 11
*** mixolydian b2
    0 1 4 5 7 9 10
*** lydian #2 #5
    0 3 4 6 8 9 11
*** locrian b7
    0 1 3 5 6 8 9
** The 2 scales of the diminished scale family
   I'm sticking to conventional names.
   If it were up to me these would be called
   "low dim" and "high dim".
*** half-whole diminished scale
    0 1 3 4 6 7 9 10
*** whole-half diminished scale
    0 2 3 5 6 8 9 11
** The 2 scales of the augmented scale family
   I'm sticking to conventional names.
   If it were up to me these would be called
   "low aug" and "high aug".
*** the mode that starts with a third
    0 3 4 7 8 11
*** the mode that starts with a second
    0 1 4 5 8 9
** The whole tone scale
   This "scale family" has only one scale.

   0 2 4 6 8 10
* the portion of scale-space that this document exhausts
  These include every symmetric scale with 6 or more tones,
  and every non-symmetric scale with exactly* 7 tones,
  subject to two constraints:

  - There cannot be more than two notes
    in any three consecutive halfsteps
    (so e.g. B C Db is not allowed).
  - The interval between any two consecutive notes
    cannot be greater than 3
    (so e.g. a jump from Bb to C# is okay,
    but a jump from Gb to A# is not).

  There exist no non-symmetric scales with more than 7 tones.
  Therefore this document characterizes
  every scale subject to the above two constraints
  with 7 or more notes,
  plus the whole tone scale.
** The proof, alas, does not fit in the margin of my spare time.
   The proof, that is, that this list exhausts the set of scales I just described.

   But it's true. I've proved it numerous times, once without even using a computer, and someone smart (Joseph Monzo?) once told me I'm right. I'm sure that would stand up in court.
* the caveat
  What I've written here is true for 12-tone music --
  which is more than 99.9% of the music you're likely to find
  if you live in the western hemisphere.
  It does not, however, apply to microtonal music --
  music in which the musicians consciously choose
  the set of possible notes,
  rather than just accepting the default collection
  provided by their piano, guitar or whatever.
* some handy Haskell code
  If you ever want to compute lots of scale modes,
  then you might find the definition of "mode" below useful.
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
  shift n l = take (length l) $ drop n $ cycle l
  mode n scale = (\x -> mod (x - scale !! n) 12) <$> shift n scale
#+END_SRC
