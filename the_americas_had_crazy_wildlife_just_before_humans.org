#+title: The Americas had crazy wildlife just before humans.
"after Sapiens got to America, most of the large animals died. There were originally Mammoths, mastatons, bear-sized rodents, giant lions and cats, herds of horses and camels, and 6m tell 8 ton ground sloths. Overall, the Americas lost 84/107 large mammals. Many of these had lived for tens of millions of years, but were extinct within 2k years of Sapiensâ€™ arrival. Some survived on Carribean islands for a while, but then disappeared after settled those islands."
