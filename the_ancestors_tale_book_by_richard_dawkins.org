#+title: The Ancestors' Tale - book by Richard Dawkins
* Population density means parasites need to care less about host survival.
  => more diseases in agricultural societies
* Hunter gatherers appear to have caused a lot of extinction.
  Particularly of big birds and mammals.
  When and where they appear in the archeological record,
  prior to the adoption of agriculture,
  those species disappear "suspiciously often".
* The border between herding and husbandry is fuzzy.
  Hunters probably started by guarding their flock and following them, then went on to feed them, and (finally?) breeding them.
* There were giant rodents.
  The biggest was the size of a rhinoceros.
