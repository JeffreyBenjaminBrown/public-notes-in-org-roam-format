#+title: The courage to be still.
* Neither productive in a familiar way
  Being still can be  productive
  (in fact I think it usually is)
  but it's often not productive in any of the obvious,
  easily measured, familiar ways.
* nor at leisure in a familiar way.
  Being still can similarly feel good in a way so unfamiliar
  that one might not at first even recognize it as feeling good.
