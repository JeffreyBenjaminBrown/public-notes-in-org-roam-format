* Set in Germany in WWII.
* noteworthy
** People relied on and hated middlemen, except when they fulfilled across-time (rather than spot) contracts that were obviously risky.
** Everyone had an idea what the just price was, but nobody could explain why.
** Experiments were tried -- a shop, a restaurant, well-intentioned communal price-fixing. The "black" market prices always won.
