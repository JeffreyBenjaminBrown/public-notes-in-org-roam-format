#+title: The FASTQ Format (Genetics)
* what's in it
** Each group of four lines is a "read".
** structure of a read
*** first line = context. We'll ignore.
  machine used to measure, experiment drawn from, etc.
*** line 2 = sequence of bases + "N"
**** "N" is used when it has too little confidence to make a call.
*** line 3 = just a plus symbol
*** line 4 = sequence of base qualities
**** This is encoded via "Phred+33"
  which converts Q to an 8-bit ASCII character,
  by rounding Q to the nearest int and adding 33.
** The reads can vary in length.
* reading it
** remember not to treat the newline character as data
