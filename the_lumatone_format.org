#+title: the Lumatone .ltn format
* everything after the word "AfterTouchActive" I don't mess with
* for the key layout
** consider this picture
   [[~/many-small/music-making/lumatone/2022-08-27-stl4uf7J.one-lumatone-octave.png]]
** the lower numbers on those keys are *almost* the names of the keys
   but the numbers in the picture start at 1,
   whereas the names are zero-indexed
** there are five "boards", each described like this
   [Board0]
   Key_0=0
   Chan_0=0
   Col_0=ff46d367
   Key_1=3
   Chan_1=1
   Col_1=ff46d367
   ...
   Key_55=28
   Chan_55=1
   Col_55=ff12dfe3
** channel, a number in [1,16], can be treated as an octave shift
** a line like Key_0=0 says that Key_0 should send MIDI note 0
