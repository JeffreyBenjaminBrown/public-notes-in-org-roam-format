#+title: The market for printers seems broken.
* reasons
** Printers are artificially cheap, because manufacturers recoup that money with the printer cartridges.
** The cartriges are rife with DRM and other incompatibilities, and cost far more than they should.
** Consumers are prevented from making their own refills, which is absurdly cheap (and still feasible, if you can stand a few Youtube tutorials).
** Nobody enters the market with a printer that costs what it should and lets you do whatever you want with it -- presumably, because consumers are too dumb/time-poor to reward the venture.
