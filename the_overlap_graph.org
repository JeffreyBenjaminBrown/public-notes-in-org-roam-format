#+title: The Overlap Graph (bioinformatics)
= a directed graph that represents the overlaps among sequences
* defining the arrow direction
Arrows point from the read that matches on its suffix to the one whose prefix it matches.
* Label the arrows with the length of the overlap.
* Discard arrows with small labels.
* We want to walk the graph.
but maybe not the whole thing, because there can be errors.
