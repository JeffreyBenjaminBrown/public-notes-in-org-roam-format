#+title: The Reverend Robert Evans memorizes star fields.
Imagine fifteen hundred tables with black table cloth and a handful of salt scattered across each. A new grain of salt appears. He spots it. It's a supernova explosion.

He's not autistic. His memory isn't good for other things -- names, or where he put stuff.

He and his wife live in Australia.
