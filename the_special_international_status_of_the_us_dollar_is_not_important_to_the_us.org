#+title: The special international status of the US dollar is not important to the US.
* https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgzGkXctVmLFSxwJThvtnzflnqFML
* maybe the biggest benefit
  The dollars held outside the US do represent a 0-interest loan, which in times of high interest rates can be meaningful -- about 0.25% of GDP.
* some non-existent benefits
** The US current account deficit is less than Britain's or Australia's.
** The US borrows at a higher interest rate than Britain or Japan.
** The British pound, which was only overtaken by the US dollar in 1955 and not special at all by 1975, has only increased in value against the dollar since.
