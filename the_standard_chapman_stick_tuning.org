** result
   gauge = frequency ~ pitch
   8	  = 293.7     ~ D4   treble
   9	  = 220.0     ~ A3   treble
   12	  = 164.8     ~ E3   treble
   18	  = 123.5     ~ B2   treble
   26u	  = 92.5      ~ F# 2 treble
   38u	  = 69.3      ~ C# 2 treble

   95u	  = 32.7      ~ C1
   65u	  = 49.0      ~ G1
   40u	  = 73.4      ~ D2
   22u	  = 110.0     ~ A2
   18	  = 164.8     ~ E2
   12	  = 246.9     ~ B2
** explanation
   This data is cobbled together -- I found the numbers on a Google image search, and Brian told me which strings are wound.
   It seems kind of absurd -- if the treble strings are 5\12 apart and the bass 7\12, why are 12 and 18 neighbors in both systems?
   treble:  8   9  12  18  26u 38u
   bass:   12  18  22u 40u 65u 95u
