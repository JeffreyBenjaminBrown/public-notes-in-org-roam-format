#+title: the topological counterpoints
* definition
  topological = modulo distance
  1 2 3 = 1 2 4, etc.
* syntax
  Each line is a separate voice.
  Time moves rightward.
* the 2 voice 2 moment counterpoints
*** parallel
**** following close
     1 2
     2 3
**** following far
     1 2
     3 4
**** jumping together
     1 3
     2 4
*** toward each other
**** about the instances
***** for each of these, reversed = away from each other
***** crossing can be indistinguishable from not crossing
      if the timbres are indistinguishable
**** instances
***** not crossing
      1 2
      4 3
***** crossing
      1 3
      4 2
*** swapping
    1 2
    2 1
    (maybe good with an octave between them)
