#+title: thinking physically while visible
* I would like
  while thinking alone,
  to react {surprise, laughter, seriousness ..} to thoughts,
  with my curtains open.
* I don't feel free to think,
  because I fear it looks insane.
* It's reasonable.
  Perusing your own knowledge, whether on paper or in your head,
  is like a conversation. It can surprise you,
  make you laugh, make you furrow your brow.

  Tht's because the data navigator
  is aware of only a tiny fraction of that navigated.
