** TODO make SC startup faster
*** These notes cut (not copied) from 1superdirt_startup.scd` explain how.
/*
This is an example startup file.
If you want to modify it, best copy it elsewhere to keep the git repository clean.

You can then load it by calling
"path/to/my/superdirt_startup.scd".load
from the supercollider startup file

The supercollider startup file is to be found in
Platform.userAppSupportDir +/+ "startup.scd",
or via the menu File > Open startup file

** TODO permit line continuations within strings
   This would be an Emacs fix,
   not a Haskell fix.

** TODO the scale stuff is buggy
   This should result in a monotonic sequence,
   but does not:

   > map (lke' 12 [0,1]) [-5..5]
   [-35.0,-36.0,-23.0,-24.0,-11.0,0.0,1.0,12.0,13.0,24.0,25.0]
*** TODO share the scale stuff
    ~/code/music/Tidal/tidal+epic/demo/scales.hs
** TODO open questions, probably
*** It's so fun sometimes, and so dumb sometimes
*** I should try 12 tones
*** The information gets too messy
**** Entangled, can't separate things, make things depend on other things without a lot of evaluation in different places in the document
**** Sprawling
*** I get locked into tiny variations of a pattern that I ought to make bigger, more destructive changes to
*** My rhythm sucks
*** What's most fun in Tidal
    is making stuff using the simple tools,
    not making more complex tools.
** TODO [[id:25d56fbf-4695-4188-bdef-61d98cc4876a][questions about the language]]
** TODO easy
*** warp (swing, etc.)
**** Define an invertible map g from straight time to warped
**** To query an arc, query the g-preimage of its endpoints, then apply g to all resulting events
*** unit-interval Rational patterns
    No new definitions needed --
      fmap (/ 10) "0 2 5 10 15"
    The result can then be multiplied by the number of scale degrees,
    even as the scale varies.
    Then quantized to an integer.
    Then harmony rules applied, ala adjustVoices and avoidDiffsMod.
*** TODO cover Moon Hooch
*** There's room for more operators in the mini syntax.
    Just use two characters.
*** make variations on `hitspan`
    using other parameters.
    `histpan` is a transition function that pans repetitions of a pattern.
** TODO harmony
*** Nudge the continuous frequency measure to align its important notes once quantized.
*** Some voices can use more out notes than others.
    For instance, perhaps on the downbeat the bass should always be in-chord while the melody need not even be in-scale.
*** Distinguish chord from within scale.
**** TODO How to use the distinction?
**** how to represent the distinction
     alternatives
***** Give a list of scale indices.
***** Provide two lists.
      one of chord notes and one of out-of-chord scale notes.
*** ? multidimensional scale indices
**** At least one dimension for priority
     e.g. root, chord, scale and "out"
     but maybe finer or coarser
**** At least one dimension for, roughly, frequency.

*** DONE I no longer need to add a line to specify `ugenPluginsPath`.
    That's necessary on my system,
    because sc3-plugins is unable to modify the SC installation
    to let SC know it exists.
