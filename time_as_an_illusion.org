#+title: time as an illusion
* justification
  Various mystical traditions have claimed that time is an illusion.
  (I am not making that claim.)
* in the physics sense
** The past and future are as real and forever as the present.
* in the mystical sense
** Is it made just through some kind of balance?
** Is it not solved but rather transcended?
* in a cognitive sense
