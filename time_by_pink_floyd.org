#+title: Time, by Pink Floyd
Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way

Tired of lying in the sunshine
Staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long
And there is time to kill today

And then one day you find
Ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run
You missed the starting gun

And you run and you run to catch up with the Sun
But it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again
The Sun is the same, in a relative way
But you're older
Shorter of breath
And one day closer to death

...[some that I'll skip] ...

Hanging on in quiet desperation
Is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over
Thought I'd something more to say

...[more that I'll skip] ...
