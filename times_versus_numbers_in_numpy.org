#+title: times versus numbers in NumPy
* the problem
  Numpy doesn't like mixing times and non-time floats.
* solutions (alternatives)
** TODO convert time to timedelta from start of 2020, then call totalseconds
   Note that the default np.float type is float64,
   what some other languages call double.
** use Pandas without NumPy
** convert time to float as library writers intended (if they did?)
*** The first table in the time documentation might help
    https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.time
*** time.time() is a float
