#+title: to study the pitches (of an edo)
* code-led
** [[/home/jeff/code/music/jam-quiz/routine.hs]]
** procedures, conceptual
*** Sing before hearing.
    serial
**** Randomly generate 3-ish pitches.
**** first pick, play a tonal center.
**** try to sing the chord.
**** then play and study it.
*** Practice arithmetic.
**** n + m = _
     for n, m in [-edo,edo]
**** edo - n = _
**** edo/k - n = _, for some very small k
     e.g. for 46-edo I'll use k=2;
     for 87-edo I'd use k=3.
*** ear-train
    [[~/code/music/montevideo/Montevideo/EarTrain/handy.hs]]
* study puns
** the Montevideo command
   intervals (harmonicLimit' (2 : 23 : [3,5..17])) 46
** BLOCKED resume at 9
* random / blind chord
  Build a chord not knowing what's in it,
  rather than aiming for a predetermined target.
* change the root of harmonic-ish series
  no precise algorithm yet
** consider the harmonic series and near neighbors (e.g. subbing 6/5 for 5/4), and try making something else the root
