#+title: to study the pitches (of an edo)
* code
** [[/home/jeff/code/music/jam-quiz/routine.hs]]
* procedures, conceptual
** Randomly generate 3-ish pitches.
   serial
*** first pick, play a tonal center.
*** try to sing the chord.
*** then play and study it.
** Practice arithmetic.
*** n + m = _
    for n, m in [-edo,edo]
*** edo - n = _
*** edo/k - n = _, for some very small k
    e.g. for 46-edo I'll use k=2;
    for 87-edo I'd use k=3.
** ear-train
