* Cliff rec's historical dramas
  Bolivar
  The Red Queen
  The White Queen
  The Normans
* Bran rec's Bojack Horseman
  """
  It's definitely bleak, but the quality of being amused with its own bleakness starts to change as they develop Bojack's character and he starts realizing that he's been hurting everyone around him and starts to seek redemption. In a nutshell, it's basically about how we must break the cycle of generational trauma and heal so we can stop hurting the people around us...punctuated by animal puns.
  If I could recommend you watch 3 episodes, they would be in order: The Old Sugarman Place, Time's Arrow, and Free Churro. The first 2 are in season 4 and the final one is in season 5.
