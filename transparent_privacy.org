#+title: transparent privacy
* the problem
** I would like to be able to say, for a node in the knowledge graph, "Unfold (in-place?) these private ideas at the same level as the public ones when viewing the contents of this public node," but in the org-roam representation, have buried those nodes as subheadlines under a "private" headline.
* an easier solution: Don't write "private" in my files.
  The filesystem and git already keeps track of that distinction.
  Anyone reading my notes just won't see that stuff.
