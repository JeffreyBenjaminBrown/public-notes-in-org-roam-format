  a**2 = b**2 + c**2 - 2 * b * c * cos A
** This holds even for "negative" lengths.
   You could solve the problem equivalently
   by making the length positive
      and using the complement of the angle.

   Solve [[id:75dd2eca-6cb9-417a-807c-dc6ce58f8397][the law of cosines]] for a:
     a = sqrt ( b**2 + c**2 -
                2 * b * c * cos A )
   As Haskell:
     a b a_angle c = sqrt ( b**2 + c**2 - 2 * b * c * cos a_angle )
