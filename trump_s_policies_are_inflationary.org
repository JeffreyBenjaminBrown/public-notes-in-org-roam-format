#+title: Trump's policies are inflationary.
8 trillion in tax cuts first term.
Promises now of trillions more in in tax cuts,
and empty promises of spending cuts (DOGE).
Increasee in spending on defense, immigration enforcement and homeland security.
Tariffs will raise prices.
Deporting immigrants will raise prices.
Threatening the federal reserve to keep interest rates low will also push up inflation.
