#+title: try Python and TypeDB \ Hode
Don't bother trying to integrate Emacs initially;
just do these things from Python.
* Create an "expression" type.
  Has at least an ID and text.
* Create a "child of" relationship template.
* Create a simple tree of expressions.
  As simple as this 7-node tree,
  where prefixes are parents:
  A AA AB AAA AAB ABA ABB
* Query for the children of some node in the tree.
  Should be a middle node.
* Query for the kinds of relationships.
* Save graph. Restore from new Docker container.
* Delete an expression.
* Create a new type in an existing graph.
* Create a new kind of relationship in an existing graph.
