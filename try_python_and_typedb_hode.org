#+title: try Python and TypeDB \ Hode
Don't bother trying to integrate Emacs initially;
just do these things from Python.
* to learn
** BLOCKED Will TypeDB let me query by iid?
   Asking on forum:
   https://forum.typedb.com/t/given-the-iid-of-something-in-the-graph-how-to-retrieve-it/558
* to make
** Create an "expression" type.
   Two fields: UID and text.
** Create a "child of" relationship template.
** Create a simple tree of expressions.
   As simple as this 7-node tree,
   where prefixes are parents:
   A AA AB AAA AAB ABA ABB
** Query for the children of some node in the tree.
   Should be a middle node.
** Query for the kinds of relationships.
** Save graph. Restore from new Docker container.
** Delete an expression.
** Create a new type in an existing graph.
** Create a new kind of relationship in an existing graph.
