#+title: try Python and TypeDB \ Hode
Don't bother trying to integrate Emacs initially.
Just do these things from Python.
* advanced, to do once I have Emacs interactivity
** Save graph. Restore from new Docker container.
** readable import/export format
*** Export graph to readable text.
**** [[id:4de226b4-1ab3-4410-ab14-1c092d1c4d32][In Bash, how to write the schema to a file.]]
*** Import the graph from readable text.
*** Make the diff readable.
    This could simply involve substituting
    (or adding) the text fields
    wherever the UID fields appear.
** extend schema interactively
*** Create a new type in an existing graph.
*** Create a new kind of relationship in an existing graph.
** Query interactively for the kinds of entities, relations.
* DONE
** Create a UID field.
   Mark it "unique".
** Create an "expression" type.
   Two fields: UID and text.
** Create a "child of" relationship template.
** Create a simple tree of expressions.
   As simple as this 7-node tree,
   where prefixes are parents:
   A AA AB AAA AAB ABA ABB
** Query for the children of some node in the tree.
   Should be a middle node.
** Success: Make a type with _ and - in the name.
   => I can use _s to indicate holes in a relation.
** Delete an expression.
tdb.data_delete ( # TRICKY: Delete requires a seemingly-redundant second "isa" clause.
  hd.DB_NAME,
  " ".join ( [
    "match $n isa note, has uid '_:i=,9aBa8C5jMmd';"
    "delete $n isa note;" ] ) )
