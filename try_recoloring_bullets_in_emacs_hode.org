#+title: try recoloring bullets in Emacs \ Hode
**** BLOCKED maybe not necessary
Rather than constantly testing whether the user just wrote a bullet, it seems easier to use a function like `M-x hode-bullet` which inserts a bullet where needed.
* some code ChatGPT suggested
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(defun my-check-and-color ()
  "Check the preceding two characters and recolor if they match a specific pattern, only in a specific buffer."
  (when (string= (buffer-name) "target-buffer")
    (let ((pattern "xy")
          (face 'font-lock-warning-face))
      (save-excursion
        (when
            (and
             (>= (point) 2)
             (string=
              (buffer-substring-no-properties
               (- (point) 2) (point))
              pattern))
          (put-text-property
           (- (point) 2) (point) 'face face))))))
