#+title: type aliases in Python
* example code
from typing import List
from typing_extensions import TypeAlias

x : TypeAlias = List[str]
y : x = ["hi"]
* PITFALL w/r/t mypy
  If mypy doesn't believe `typing` exports `GenericAlias`,
  the word `GenericAlias` can be omtted from the above
  (and its accompanying punctuation)
  and it will typecheck in mypy and continue to function,
  although from a less beautiful representation.
