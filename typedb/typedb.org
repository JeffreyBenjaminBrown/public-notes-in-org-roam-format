* PITFALLs
** Docs use "query" to mean more than read ops.
** "fetch" and "get" do different things!
   I don't understand the difference, but here are examples:

     tx.query.get (
       "match $n isa note; get $n;" )
     tx.query.fetch (
       "match $p isa person; fetch $p: name;")
** The official Docker image is too old for the Python driver.
   That is, the most recent Python it makes available (via apt)
   is one for which no TypeDB Python driver exists.
   I solved this by building a new Docker image,
   using Ubuntu, that installs TypeDB via apt.

** DONE Roles are inherited.
   That is, I don't have to define that a type can play a role,
   if I already stated that its parent can.
** DONE If you delete an entity, the relationships it was in persist!
   with holes
** DONE Attributes are not unique per owner!
   This suggests they aren't:
   "A person can have more than one attribute of type full-name. Every instance of attribute will get to the results."

** How to enforce attribute uniqueness (various kinds)?
*** global attribute uniqueness
    The attribute might uniquely ID its owner.
*** within-type (and subtypes) attribute uniqueness
*** within-entity attribute uniqueness
*** within-type relationship uniqueness defined by members
    rather than members *and* attributes
