#+title: TypeDB should report constraint violations to Skg.
* Report upon discovery during save-buffer, yet succeed.
* good constraints
** Each extra_id should be in at most one has_extra_id relationship.
** Each id value should belong to only one entity.
   where entity = node | extra_id
* TypeDB is probably better for finding them.
* Some states are invalid or redundant.
** IDs should be unique.
** Redundant state is possible.
*** A node can 'hide from subscriptions' something it contains.
    'contains' should imply 'hides from subscriptions'.
    (That is, the server should not display
    in one of a node's subscriptions
    something already shown in the node's content.)
