#+title: UIDs in TypeDB
https://forum.typedb.com/t/given-the-iid-of-something-in-the-graph-how-to-retrieve-it/558

In TypeDB 3.0, the IID (or maybe it will have a different name -- see below) might become immutable and remain user-facing.

In TypeDB 2.0, there is an "iid" ("internal ID") field,
but it is mutable. It is user-facing only through deprecated, undocumented functions like "iid". They recommend implementing my own immutable ID field if I want such a field.
