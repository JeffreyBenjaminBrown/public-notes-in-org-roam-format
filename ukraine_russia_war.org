** he describes it
   "For anyone who'd like to see the real implications of this atrocious and pointless war, I suggest checking the FB account of Serhiy Gorobcov (link below), an orthodox priest in the besieged city of Mariupol. Dead civilians right on the street, mass graves, shelling of residential areas and even maternity hospitals, including from fighter jets."
