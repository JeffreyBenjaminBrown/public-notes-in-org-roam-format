#+title: unduplicate (find unique members in) a set of sets or lists in Python
In Python one cannot define sets of sets, nor sets of lists.
That is because those types are not hashable,
because they are mutable
(and mutabted keys would invalidate the hashes).
Tuples are immutable, though, so sets of tuples are feasible.
Moreover tuples can be sorted (e.g. `sorted ( (2,1,3) )` ).
