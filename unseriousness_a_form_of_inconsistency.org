#+title: unseriousness , a form of inconsistency
* How to distinguish between unseriousness and overcommitment?
* [[id:543d4a74-b24c-41d3-b93d-79d9c86eadf3][Partial completion can be of almost no value.]]
* example & rebuttal
** maybe stale
I may have written the example when I was working very little on the shared graph project, which would explain the simplicity of the rebuttal now.
** example
I'm not acting like I take the mindmapping project seriously.
** rebuttal
Am I not, though? Not working on it all the time does not mean neglecting it. If anything I neglect my social life for it.
