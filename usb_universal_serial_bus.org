  Use lsblk to determine which drive it is.
  Make sure it's not mounted.
  Then:
    # PITFALL: This won't work, because sdxxx does not exist.
    # Put something sensible there (see above).
    sudo dd if=/path/to/the.iso of=/dev/sdxxx bs=1M
* mount|unmount a USB drive
** mount
   This mounts the device "sdb1",
   making it available at the "media" folder.

   sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/media
** unmount
   umount /path/where/device/is/mounted
   After this the device will still be visible in /dev,
   but not manipulable at the above long path.
