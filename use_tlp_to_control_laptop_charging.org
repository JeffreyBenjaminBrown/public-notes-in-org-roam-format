* hasn't worked
  I tried to put these settings right after the line
    powerManagement.enable = true;
    but it generates errors.
* the settings
  services.tlp = {
        enable = true;
        settings = {
         START_CHARGE_THRESH_BAT0 = 75;
         STOP_CHARGE_THRESH_BAT0  = 80;

#          CPU_SCALING_GOVERNOR_ON_AC    = "performance";
#          CPU_SCALING_GOVERNOR_ON_BAT   = "powersave";
#          CPU_ENERGY_PERF_POLICY_ON_BAT = "power";
#          CPU_ENERGY_PERF_POLICY_ON_AC  = "performance";

#          CPU_MIN_PERF_ON_AC            = 0;
#          CPU_MAX_PERF_ON_AC            = 100;
#          CPU_MIN_PERF_ON_BAT           = 0;
#          CPU_MAX_PERF_ON_BAT           = 20;
        };
  };
