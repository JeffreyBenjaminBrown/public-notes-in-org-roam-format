#+title: using Burnside's lemma to count triads
* interpreting the theorem for music
  In this application a "coloring" is an assignment of 1s and 0s to the 12 tones such that 3 of them are 1 and the rest are 0. An "orbit" is a set of colorings that can be mapped to each other by one of the symmetries. The symmetries can be labeled +0 (the identity), +1, +2 ... +11.
* triads in 12-edo
  Let the 12 transpositional symmetries be labeled +0, +1, +2 ... +11
  |orbits| = (1/12) * sum of
    [ +0 = identity -> 12 choose 3 = 220
    , +1            -> 0
    , +2            -> 0
    , +3            -> 0
    , +4            -> 4 (there are 4 augmented chords, which are the only ones fixed under the transformation +4)
    , +5            -> 0
    , +6            -> 0
    , +7            -> 0
    , +8            -> 4 (the augmented chords again)
    , +9            -> 0
    , +10           -> 0
    , +11           -> 0 ]
    = 228 / 12
    = 19
* triads in 41-edo
  orbits = (1/41) *
           sum [ 0               -> 41 choose 3 = 10660
               , everything else -> 0 ]
    = 10660 / 41 = 260
