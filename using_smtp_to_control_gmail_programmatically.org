#+title: using SMTP to control Gmail programmatically
* Sometimes messages don't get delivered.
** It's always been Gmail's fault.
   That is, so far, each time it's happened to me.
** solutions
*** enable "less secure apps"
*** 2FA and a special "app key"
**** the story
     https://stackoverflow.com/a/60075311/916142
     I enabled 2-step verification,
     and then generated a special different password for the same email account,
     for use with an app.
     To Google I called the app Phanaeros,
     but I don't think Gmail actually reads a name of my Python code,
     which is good because it has none.
     In the process I had to answer a lot of security emails from Gmail.
     Some things failed and then,
     after futzing with security prompts they generated,
     succeeded on the next try.
**** the keys it generated
     [[id:bea0f047-9bb1-469c-a278-1d46890254a6][keys generated for programmatic SMTP control of Gmail on or before <2022-02-17>]]
* if I see "Temporary failure in name resolution"
** Rebooting made it go away!
** the error at length (probably useless to me)
