#+title: utilitarianism
* the axiom
  Anyone's happiness is good, and their unhappiness bad --
  i.e. to be striven for and against respectively.
* There are, of course, tradeoffs.
  Some unhappiness can result from a good thing.
* Summing utility across people is hard.
** and yet
   it is possible to identify kinds of selfishness that roughly everyone agrees are evil
