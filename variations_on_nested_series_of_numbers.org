* tricks in it
** ways for there to be one number
*** ways for 4 to be 4
    There are four things.
    Things 1 through 4.
    There's 4.
*** similar for 2
** ways for there to be M and N numbers
   The sequence from 1 to M+N.
   M+N numbers of any kind.
   The number M+N.
   One way to be N and another to be M.
** cast doubt on the seed instruction
   Can play with whether it is the sequence M,N,
   or just the set, being rendered to time.
   For instance, render the sequence M,N many times,
   then swap them,
   but a careful listener can discover
   that the sequence plays out in order
   in the history of those swaps.
** ways for (a sequence of variations of S) to be S
*** render M,N one way M times, then a different way N times
** a pattern to be done to any pattern/sequence
   pattern pattern pattern 3
