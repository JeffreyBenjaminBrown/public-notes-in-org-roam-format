#+title: Venezuela's collapse and exporters in Colombia
* = notes on a paper by Carlos Hernandez ad MinCIT
* Colombian manufacturers exported to Veneuela.
* Chavez started a boycott of Colombian goods in 2009.
* Venezuela (continued? started?) collapsing thereafter.
* Colombian exporters exposed to V shrank and stayed that way, but (total country?) productivity did not [change? go off-trend?].
