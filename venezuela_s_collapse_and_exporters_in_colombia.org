#+title: Venezuela's collapse and exporters in Colombia
* = notes on a paper presented at MinCIT by Nicolas something, prof at Los Andes
* from the abstract
** Colombian manufacturers exported to Veneuela.
** Chavez started a boycott of Colombian goods in 2009.
** Venezuela (continued? started?) collapsing thereafter.
** Colombian exporters exposed to V shrank and stayed that way, but (total country?) productivity did not [change? go off-trend?].
* data sources
** EAM (encuesta nacional manufacturas)
** DIAN (for exports -- destination, volume, date, more)
* time windows
  pre-treatment: 2005–2008
  post-treatment: 2009–2018 (after the Venezuelan import ban)
* some history
** 1999: Chavez gains power
** 2003: Chavez introduces price controls, currency exchange restrictions
** Chavez's goals and results with the import restrictions (the focus of the paper)
*** goals: food sovereignty and reduce dependency on foreign goods
*** effect: shortages, more
* sectors
** Textiles and clothing were hit hard.
* criticisms
** Why assign an arbitrary cutoff?
*** elaboration
    Why discrete diff-in-diff, rather than treat a firm's export share to Venezuela as a continuous variable, which it is?
** endogeneity problem
*** the problem
    Firms lower in productivity or foresight might be the ones most likely to (still) trade with Venezuela when the measurement of their export share to Venezuela was made.
*** it affects both diff-in-diff and continuous approaches
* questions
** What year do they use to determine export share?
** How much DIAN data was invalid?
   i.e. no country or nonpositive value
** How did productivity vary across firms?
** Is it legally hard to start exporting to a new country?
** TODO What distinguished exporters to Venezuela from others?
