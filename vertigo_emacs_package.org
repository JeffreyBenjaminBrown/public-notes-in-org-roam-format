#+title: vertigo (Emacs package)
I think I prefer avy.
* what it does
  vertigo lets you jump to lines marked by the sidebar.
  It uses relative line numbering.
* pros
  Sidebar numbers are easier to read than the highlights avy makes.
* cons
  Chews up some space at the right side.
  Plays badly with org-mode.
  Jumps always to the start of the line.
* the .emacs code I was using for it
  ;; vertigo: jump many lines from home keys
  (global-linum-mode)		;; always show line numbers
  (linum-relative-global-mode)	;; make them relative
  (global-set-key (kbd "M-p") 'vertigo-jump-up)
  (global-set-key (kbd "M-n") 'vertigo-jump-down)
