#+title: VST (audio plugin format)
* how to install a VST plugin in Linux
** PITFALL: The extension might be ".so" -- i.e., not obvious.
   Pianoteq's VST plugin, for instance, is called
     Pianoteq_8.so
** this probably works
   There's a VST_PATH shell variable,
   so probably the same procedure works for VST
   as [[id:6fafebf2-4a90-4f75-8b5d-a6593dc515f0][the procedure for LV2]],
   changing each instance of the string VST to the string LV2.
