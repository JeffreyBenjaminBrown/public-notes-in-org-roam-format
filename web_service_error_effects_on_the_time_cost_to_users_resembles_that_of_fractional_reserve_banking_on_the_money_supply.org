#+title: Web service errors' effects on the time cost to users resembles those of fractional reserve banking on the money supply.
* the idea
  Suppose there is a 50% failure rate.
  100 users send a solicitud.
  50 of those have to send a second one.
  25 of those have to send a third one.
  Etc.
  The total number of solicitudes sent is 200.

  Thus, for example, reducing the error rate from 90% to 50%
  reduces the total time cost to users by a factor of 5.
* the communications upshot
  is that when reporting an improvement in the error rate,
  one should also report the (much more impressive)
  improvement in the service's time cost to users.
