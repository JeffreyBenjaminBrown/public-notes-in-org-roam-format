* How I sent it to the DJ
Buenas noches, Yulieth! Aquí Jeff, de la boda con Sandy el martes. Te envío un playlist para el DJ (cuyo información de contacto no tengo). Está dividio en dos secciones, para no bailar y para bailar. Entre esos secciones está aún más dividido por la velocidad.

No tiene que tocar toda esta música -- no habría tiempo. Pido que toca lo que le parece más apropiado. También puede tocar lo que quiera de música latina, la cual no conozco muy bien. La música que sirve para bailar también serviría para no bailar, pero al reves no -- donde dice "no para bailar" es porque sería difícil bailar.
