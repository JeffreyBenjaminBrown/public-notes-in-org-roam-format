#+title: when Isaac Newton met Edmond Halley
* (Halley of Halley's comet)
* Halley asked Newton what a comet's orbit would be under the inverse square law for gravity.
* Newton replied immediately, "An ellipse."
* Halley was overjoyed, because he had seen this. He asked Newton how he knew.
* Newton said he had calculated it. But then he couldn't find the calculation.
* Newton promised to redo the calculation. He did. Then he retired for two years, to emerge with the Principia Mathematica.
