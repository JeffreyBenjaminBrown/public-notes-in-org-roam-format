#+title: when to pause
* When I'm not sure my priorities are straight, consider meditating (on it).
  examples
** when I have witnessed injustice and am tempted to ignore it and get on with my own work
** when feeling like I'm ignoring something hard for something easy
* when feeling angry, annoyed or otherwise uncharitable
** TODO Try pointing out, kindly, how I feel to whoever is pissing me off.
* when feeling nervous about a decision in progress

** Ask for more time when an irreversible operation is about to happen.
   Then use that time to think about how to assure the outcome is okay,
   or how to gracefully back out.
** when feeling pressured into a decision
   e.g. by salespeople
* when I notice myself *suppressing* feelings of nervousness
  e.g. if I'm about to do something that might be stupid,
  consider in detail the potential negative consequences.
