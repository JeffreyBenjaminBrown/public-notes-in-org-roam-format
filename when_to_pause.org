#+title: when to pause
* Ask for more time when an irreversible operation is about to happen.
  Then use that time to think about how to assure the outcome is okay,
  or how to gracefully back out.
* Meditate when I'm not sure my priorities are straight.
  esp. when I have witnessed injustice or other bad choices in others.
