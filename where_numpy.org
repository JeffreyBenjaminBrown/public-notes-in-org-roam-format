#+title: where \ Numpy
* like "if" for vectors, somehow faster than "apply"
* Example: Set new column "c" same as "a" when "b" is missing, else 10.
  # Note that this could be done more concisely with `fillna`.

  if True: # imports
     import numpy as np
     import pandas as pd
  z = pd.DataFrame ( { "a" : [1,2     ,3],
                       "b" : [0,np.nan,0], } )
  z["c"] = np.where ( z["b"].isnull(), # condition
                      z["a"],          # used if True  (b is missing)
                      10 )             # used if False (b is present)
* PITFALL: an index with holes in it causes errors.
  That is, an index in which there exist two adjacent values
  such that the latter is not the former plus 1.

  I can't make a simple example,
  but there's an example (the only use of `where`,
  with a big `PITFALL: WTF` comment) in
    `python/extract_excel/gastos.py`
  in the project
