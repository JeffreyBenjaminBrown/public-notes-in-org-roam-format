#+title: show cotargeters, coancestors
* TODO Generalizatie further?
* how to show them
** Sometimes put the child view-under both parents.
*** elaboration
    Definitely at least sometimes,
    each coparent should show between
    the initial parent and its children.
*** the initial parent should then come first
    to be shared by all its coparents in a later view-generation
** But sometimes that is not screen-efficient
*** a(the?) case
    If a single child has many parents,
    it would be duplicated under each coparent.
    Better in that case to show the coparents as
    view-children of the child.
** This implies some kind of tradeoff to optimize.
