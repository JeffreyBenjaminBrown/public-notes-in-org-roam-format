#+title: Why code duplication is dangerous.
* How I lost 2 days of work to a duplication mistake.
  If two functions look very similar,
  that should smell bad for yet another reason:
  Once I'm using one of them and not the other,
  I might edit the other (unused) one thinking I'm editing the one in use.
  Then when it doesn't work, I'll look for a solution elsewhere at length.
