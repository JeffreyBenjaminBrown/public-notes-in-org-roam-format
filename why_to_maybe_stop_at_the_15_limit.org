#+title: why to maybe stop at the 15-limit
* [[id:9cdeafc9-698c-43b1-b02c-88062ea298dc][Harmonic 23 is not worth it.]]
* By similar logic, the 19th and 17th aren't worth it.
* By contrast, harmonic 15 is a full 16.5c from the nearest 13-limit ratio,
  and in the full 15-limit,
  no two ratios appear to be nearer than 10 cents to each other.
