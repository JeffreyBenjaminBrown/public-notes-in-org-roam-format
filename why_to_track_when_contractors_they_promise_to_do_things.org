#+title: Why to track when and how contractors promise things.
* behavioral implications
** Don't take someone who says "I will do it" at their word.
** Record what they promised, and when.
** Put it in writing that they recognize the promise.
** Schedule (personally) when to follow up.
* story, explanation
It feels like after they say when they'll do something -- lately, show us evidence that a tool works -- and the time comes, they either say they'll do it later, or say they already did it.

I therefore have to remember when they promised to do it, and try to hold them to it.

This is particularly challenging because they don't act antagonistic. They act like colleagues, as if I can trust them because our interests are aligned, when they are not.

The problem reveals an interesting anti-legalistic aspect of how I (and, I believe, other colleagues who have repeatedly run into this problem) think: When we talk about an issue with someone, and come to an agreement on what to do about it, I don't seem to mentally record the minutiae of what will be done. I instead update my model of the other person, such that they now are aware of the problem I was aware of, and that they plan to solve it and prove they have done so, in good faith.
