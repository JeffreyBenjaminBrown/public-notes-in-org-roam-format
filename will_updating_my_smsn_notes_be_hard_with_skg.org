#+title: Will updating my SmSN notes be hard with Skg?
* [[id:61f58054-3032-4e45-bfda-dbc278c040d7][some vocab]]
* It seems to be easier* than [[id:18047d85-01cc-4323-bcc0-27c24524dc98][graph, that is multi-node, merges]]
  (*) Easier because one can ignore the branch in that note
  about nodes that were mergeed or divided.
* TODO But what if I want to push back to smsn?
