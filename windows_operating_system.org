** Prevent Edge tabs appearing individually when pressing Alt-Tab
*** source
    I googled
      why does alt tab in windows show every Edge tab
    and found, among much else,
      https://www.howtogeek.com/696775/how-to-stop-alttab-from-showing-edge-browser-tabs/
*** recipe
    Windows Settings
    System -> Multitasking
    Scroll to "Pressing Alt-Tab shows" and click
    Select "Open Windows Only"
** Disable Cortana
   It's one of the startup apps,
   and can be disabled from that list.
** Reverse scroll direction
   Settings -> Touchpad -> Scroll & Zoom

** escape from Windows 10 S to Windows 10
*** why

    You need to login to MS to use the computer.
    If the login breaks you can't even type.
*** how
**** It's not actually a separate OS; it's a crippled Windows 10.
**** S-mode can be deactivated, never reactivated.
*** maybe a helpful story
