#+title: wsgi and mod_wsgi
* refs
** my working config
is in my `learning-aws` repo,
under `python-web-app/apache/apache2.conf`,
as of commit 5e7acafc661fb3396af47d97510b0690eb26465a.
** Configuring wsgi
https://modwsgi.readthedocs.io/en/develop/user-guides/quick-configuration-guide.html#delegation-to-daemon-process
** DONE I asked about configuration on the Django forum
 https://forum.djangoproject.com/t/do-i-need-apache-if-so-im-lost-configuring-it/4791
* some definitions
** wsgi is a Python web interface
** mod_wsgi is an Apache module
 which can host any Python WSGI application, including Django.
* TODO Eventually, replace www.example.com
with my actual domain.
* TODO ? PITFALL: configure apache from /etc/apache2/mods-*/
  rather than its parent folder
* PITFALL: permissions are tricky
The Docker image deals with them, as of version
    ofiscal/tax.co:2020-10-16.apache-access
