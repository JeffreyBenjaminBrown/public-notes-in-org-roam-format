  After [[id:28381263-5c19-4566-967d-492126759085][finding the list]], it's obvious how to add one,
  but it doesn't work.
  At /home/jeff/bin I have two scripts:
    xfce-zoom-in.sh
    xfce-zoom-out.sh
  If I add a shortcut to the first, it still won't run.
  I've tried adding a shortcut both to the file itself (which is executable)
  and to `sh <name of file>`.
