* Xmonad is lightweight.
* Xmonad can work with KDE.
* Enabling Xmonad on NixOS takes one line.
   It might (I'm not sure) require some additional futzing to make it work with KDE, but enabling it in the config is easy:
   services.xserver.windowManager.xmonad.enable;
* solutions
** full-screen zoom in Xmonad
   [[id:a571e570-667a-432d-9144-dd163c519900][boomer (platform-independent screen zoom application)]]
   Or use it in [[id:5ec64c3d-c92f-4bd5-a280-718ac69f83f9][a Linux desktop environment with native zoom]].
