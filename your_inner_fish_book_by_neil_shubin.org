* "Talking did not come cheap."
** We use the same hole to talk, eat and breathe.
*** => choking hazard
** Apnea only happens in humans (and pugs?).
   Stuff in our throats got soft in order to permit speech.
* Returning blood from the feet is somewhat elaborate.
** Blood pressure is higher in arteries than in the veins.
** Valves in leg veins prevent blood going backward.
** The leg muscles move the blood back up when we walk.
** If the blood pools in the veins, it can cause the valves to fail.
   This is called varicose veins.
   They swell and take tortuous paths.
** Too much sitting can cause hemmorhoids.
   Blood pools in the veins around the rectum.

* the common limb structure
  All vertebrates that came from (but aren't) fish have the same structure for their limbs: one bone, then two bones, then a bunch of lumpy things, and then digits. Even whales have little stubbly legs and feet, inside their bellies.
